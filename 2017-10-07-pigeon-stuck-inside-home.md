Today a pigeon got stuck inside a window frame. I'm terrified by pigeons, their spontaneous air lifts especially. But seeing him stuck, helpless i was convinced that i had to get rid of my fear and help him.

Interestingly just 5 seconds of insane courage helped me get over my fear. Once i gently touched him, reluctant to do so but i forced my self, talking to myself- "You can do it" and it happened.

Amazing how we can influence our actions just my talking to our self, inducing self belief in ourselves.

I tried to lift him but a lot of times failed, he would simply explode to fly out and i would freak out dropping him back to square one.

But I didn't give up, i tried and tried and tried, took me over an hour but finally i did. I rescued a pigeon!

It was phenomenal, i felt i had done something great today. I felt fulfilled and interestingly i could now focus more on my work(studies-IPCC), i had a sense of responsibility over me now, a pressure to keep the positive energy going on. Maybe by helping others or doing self-fulfilling tasks we get more responsible, more attentive to issues at hand with induced belief that we can get over them, achieve our goals.

The pigeon stuck signified people living their lives stuck in the vicious cycle of payments-earnings, financial captivity.

People stuck in lives just like the pigeon, with their problems, missing opportunities, unable to create new ones. And at this moment all they require is 5 seconds of insane courage, it really works like charm, and they can turn their lives around swiftly.

A pigeon taught me a lot- to never back down, handle stress situations calmly, exhibit insane courage sometimes, illusions that get you stuck- daydreaming, hoping loved ones will revive back, etc.
