I went for a run today, its day 2. Yesterday Fyers accepted the refund demand from my side, i went for a run in the evening yesterday at the Rathi park, but today even in absence of lights in Gold Souk adjacent park as situation is no different in Rathi park.

Initially i had planned that i would run 3 laps just like yesterday, however upon completion of 2nd lap i had an inner thought that i won't be able to complete 5 laps had i planned in such way and i agreed with the inner voice that it can't be done, i accepted it. I didn't believe that its possible, had no self belief.

But then just as 2.5 laps got completed i thought to myself no matter what i will do this, i will complete 5 laps no matter what whether i faint or my heart bursts.

Note that i had no self belief but had the will power. Self Belief leads to overconfidence, because we assume ourselves to be capable of achieving while will power constitutes power of achieving goals where we don't project ourselves to be capable enough.

There was a time upon 2.5 laps being completed that i will not be able to do another 2.5 laps, no way thats not possible but i had this stubborness of "not quiting"- moving on with what i "have" to do. There were voices inside my mind which were constantly telling me to stop, coming up with numerous "logical-rational" reasons such as possibility of fainting or heart failure or "its not good for me" or too strenous for day-2, or its not rational-logical to be too hard on yourself only on day 2, all such negative- discouraging thoughts came and sometime in between i decided to stop but that very moment i held onto my will power that i won't stop until i'm done, i'm doing this for me so fuck logic-rationality-reason.

I'm running and constantly my mind wants to stop, its out of control, all voices within my mind are discouraging me to continue, telling me that all done is "still very good and impressive" and i should stop now as it is already way more than acceptable if less than the goal set but i'm telling myself that i won't stop until i reach my goal- i have the will power that i will sustain my efforts until i succeed. I simply refused to pay any heed to anything that was not in line with my set goal.

There was a time when i tried to quote Agneepath poem but just after initiation i disgarded it as i knew my will power is supremo at this point of time than everything else, all motivational quotes- role models, etc.

I simple didn't stop for even a second or less, kept on going alongside my will power, zidd-stuborness.

I went on rejecting all discouraging thoughts and inner voices, focussing only on my will-power that no matter what i'm completing this, there's no other option for me.
