Hey Guys!

I'm looking for daily commuter data from major metro stations in order to create an efficient system of transportation by collaborating with CNG autos.

Why CNG Autos only?

Low Emissions Cost Effective, higher savings Low occupants required as compared to bigger diesel autos having higher occupancy Quick to fill up with daily commuters, therefore reducing waiting time.

I'm a student at Delhi University, and i'm impressed by the way the auto drivers at Malviya Nagar metro station have optimized there system of operations by collaborating together. If you've been there you must have observed how quickly, without any unnecessary delay, we're able to get to our destinations at most effective cost. The way they work by sharing rides with each other not only provides cost optimization of merely Rs.10 per commuter but also increased daily earnings through efficient allocation and reduction of idle waiting time.

Likewise in Gurgaon, where i live, though there are sharing autos(much bigger than the CNG ones) and bike taxis(which recently have gained quite an attraction from daily commuters) but the biggest problems i see are:

Environmental-Pollution High cost of travel (which is excatly what such bike taxis and sharing autos have trailed against, thus gained high revenue) Wastage of time(waiting for sharing autos, they take time to start the journey until its fully occupied, atleast 20mins for 1st person) Extra effort(daily bargaining) that is required by commuters.

Its not that CNG autos are not available, they are! but they don't charge commuters on a sharing basis. Why? Because they are not able to figure out prime routes they can drive on to maximise their earnings, for which i'm looking for commuting data. (Refer: http://ilikebigbytes.com/index.php/2016/05/18/acs-commuter-data-visualizations/)

Such data would enable us to provide insights as to what routes to "standardize". This is imperative for creating a constant system of commuting to avoid confusion both for commuters and for auto drivers.
