1. Small retailers seem to have no CRM, unable to manage customers by nudging them with better offers which would improve cashflows & sales.
    - If one could connect payment gateway(Paytm, UPI, CC) to automatically fetch contact details. Use this t/n history to gause preferences/ new product acceptance probability.

2. High frequency products like (Haircare~ Shampoo, conditioner, oils; Face care: "Facewash, scrub; Grocery items, etc.) can have improved launches by offering samples."
    - For instance, propensity to try out different shampoo is higher for shampoo satchets(one could get them earlier easily) vs 650ml bottle.
    - Converting customer has to be via internal motivation achievable by 'nudging'/ offering small-affordable samples that don't stick for a while.
    This achieves lesser 'nominal' cost in customer's mind as he loses fewer days to 'new' product.
