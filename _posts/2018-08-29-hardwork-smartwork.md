Which is better, smart work or hard work?

Pure hard work: Reading books all day, going through all the materials and staying awake at night before the exam to ensure you’ve revised everything

Smart hard work: Knowing that the professor gives importance to assignments, tutorials, and questions in the book; doing them well before the exam, and getting a good night’s sleep The funny thing is that smart hard work is actually harder than pure hard work because it requires situational awareness, taking cues and prioritization. These are useful skills that are fundamental differentiators in life.
