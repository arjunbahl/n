Zindagi mein agar safal hona hai toh junoon hona chaiye uss cheez ke liye, pagalpan hona chaiye, duniya bole ki yeh pagal ho gaya hai.

Pagalpanti dikhni chaiye duniya ko, just like Bishan Singh Bedi and Shoaib Akhtar said. When Shoaib Akhtar cited that people in his street would call him as "pagala". They would say "oh dekh pagala ja rha hai" and he would tell everyone that he would be great one day, he believed it deep in heart as well. And he enjoyed every bit of it, "aage bhaage jaa bss bhaage ja dont be bitter, enjoy it", "maafi ke liye bada bn".

You gotta be madman itna junoon hona chaiye. Extraordinary people have that touch of madness, pagalpan.

Aur aakhir mein sukoon milna chaiye aise kaam se.
