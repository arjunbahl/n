Recently, I was summoned to a GD(Group Discussion) as a part of selection process for being an esteemed member of my college's _Management Society_ or preferred slang _M.Soc._

It was 1st September and probably the 1st GD of my life. I went to my college, College Of Vocational Studies. Attended my classes and dawn of M.Soc bestowed upon me. As i was walking towards my Eco class, _Kartik_, member and moderator of M.Soc crossed my trail and summoned me for the selection process. First round was GD(Group Discussion). Without thinking much i entered the small room with beefed up chairs and tables. I sat on the one that was exactly in front of moderator's table. Sudden anxiety, nervousness started to overlap my confidence. Sitting with legs tightly wrapped around and anticipating various scenarios in my mind i saw my opponents entering the room.

Soon everyone was settled and Kartik entered. He made us familiar with code of conduct and strategies. The topic was _"Friends With Money Or Friends With No Money"._ Just like everyone else i started jotting down my main points in brief. I would support _"Friends With MONEY",_ as i knew most of them would support the other one. I believed that friendship shouldn't be taken as a complementary part of money. Friendship was something that is void of anything that can't be quantified.

After jotting them down, suddenly i heard "Start!". The one in the extreme corner started by supporting "Friends With Money". And i knew if i allow him the chance to speak endlessly he would eat up all my points. Therefore 3 seconds after i interrupted him with my very crisp and clear, _"EXACTLY"_, he stopped, my confidence shot up just like a Kepler rocket. I started with my arguments as follows:

> _Friendship is something that i believe cannot be quantified. It's much more than that. On the other side i would rather support Friends With Money, because even if you are compassionate with someone who has loads of money with him how does it would affect you or more importantly your friendship? You cannot connect these two dots, they are apples and oranges._

And as i was fitting in the discussion, a girl beside me interrupted:

> What if someone befriends you, who has loads of money, just to benefit his own needs, like a need for company?

A little dumbstruck, i started to defend my argument,

> So what? What if after a month or two we become friends for life, inseparable. What if we could complete each other? What if he fills the void with his company?

I knew moderators were impressed as i could see one of them glistening. I continued,

> Friendship is something that is much bigger than money, obviously it would benefit me if my friend has loads of money. Why? Because, be it the ugly truth of life, or a moral lie, a life without money is shit. Being with such a person would force me to be successful and more importantly self sufficient, which i think is a necessity.

As i stopped the boy in the extreme corner added on it. I sat quietly in pride, observing every moment. A satisfied voice came around, "OK let's stop it here", Kartik said.

"How about a drill? I'm gonna give a topic to the one in the extreme corner and he would start speaking for about a minute or two and with the last three words the person next to him will start his topic"

Being on cloud nine, i could drop the moon down upon us. In mind i was saying to myself, "Bring it On..". The initial topic given to the fellow was "_Food comes before anything for Indians"._ Dumbstruck, the boy said, words that would ignite me, _"I don't know"._ The moderators pushed him a little bit but he gave up.

I couldn't afford to miss such an opportunity, i started as:

> "I don't know" is a phrase which i believe is one that can completely devastate a person's life. Even if you don't know atleast you should speak something even if its is off the topic, simply surrendering to god's will is no path to success. I think it gives way to the belief that you have lost hope, but Hope is a Good thing and No Good Thing Ever Dies. Uhm..Uhmm. You..

I was done, but unfortunately, boy succeeding me was given a poor set of choice. I didn't care, i was very happy. Finally GD was concluded, I was proud of myself, after a huge gap i could speak to a bunch of people with sheer confidence and insight that too spontaneously.

I learnt that doing things that you fear spontaneously is a better way to get over your fears rather than planning it out to perform.

Thanks

And Live Prosperous!
