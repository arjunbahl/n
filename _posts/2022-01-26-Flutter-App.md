Special Forces: "Your Choice (let's say you're greedy and love to eat sweets in front of you, its now your choice whether to eat in balance proportion or eat excessively and become a bum), SF is a state of mind- leave us in jungle with no clothes we'll come back, surrounded us we'll hit them and make it back, Fuckin put a bullet into his head, Let go- hang on a thread- on the edge, calm in chaos, train to live under pressure-probation for life, constant choice and pressure under which we work, Nothing is impossible, nothing, nothing, nothing, machine gun firing ambush-hiding in the nala between mountains- whole column- the man who stands now and returns fire and gives shit back is the natural leader-bhoot bana diya saalo ka-you have to take it no one gonna give you"

Investment banking- doing today vs tomorrow, During my internship at Barclays Capital I was assigned to a team of 3 that took positions as big as the rest of the trading floor combined. It was the heavy weight dream team of 3 ex Goldman bankers. And me! The team’s head was Marc Cheval (might be spelled wrong, can’t seem to find him on Google). Anyway, Marc was once giving me a lift on his way back home in his flashy sports car, and said, Look, Asim, a lot of people say they will learn French, or lose weight, or they will read some book. The difference between most other people and me is that I don’t do them tomorrow, I actually do them. Today. He explained, I’m tired right now, but I don’t care. I’m going to drop you off, get home, and I will read at least a couple of chapters of [some finance book I can’t recall]. I don’t care how tired I am. I am going to get through a couple of chapters. Because I don’t do things tomorrow. I do them today.

Kohli: "i try but woh agr khatm hogaya In the last 10 years have you ever woken up not feeling 150% passionate cause I believe you wake up feeling 150% passionate every day when you go to play. – Everyone has off days. – Ive woken up feeling a sense of detachment from what Im doing. Thinking that I dont want to do this. But that has been because of excessive pressure thats been on me during a difficult phase. But still, Ive had the ability to still tell myself no. I’ll go out and try once morehe day you lose the will to go out and try once more then you can’t do anything and No one can convince youo chance. So what is the motivation? Motivation is just about winning. The day I lose my passion, I’ll stop playing."

Once a young man asked Socrates the secret to success. Socrates asked the young man to meet him at the riverside the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the water and he did. Suddenly Socrates ducked the kid underwater and held him there till the kid started turning blue. Then, Socrates pulled him out. The first thing the kid did was to take a deep breath. Socrates asked him, ‘Son, when you were under water what did you want the most?’ The young man said, ‘Air.’ Socrates said, ‘Son, there is no secret to success. When you want success, as badly as you wanted air when you were in the water you will have it. Nobody will be able to stop you that day.’ This is called a burning desire. This is the difference between preferences and convictions in life; preferences are negotiable, convictions are not; and under pressure, preferences always become weak whereas convictions become stronger.

Using the Rule is simple. Whenever you feel an instinct fire up to act on a goal or a commitment, or the moment you feel that yourself hesitate on doing something and you know you should do, use the Rule. Physical movement is the most important part of my Rule, too, because when you move your physiology changes and your mind follows.

Rocky balboa- world ain't no sunshine; not about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward

Steve jobs- details; Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary
Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again
Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently - they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.; When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can often times arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions.; 
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
If you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution. The most important decisions you make are not the things you do, but the things you decide not to do. 
(Michael Fasbender- no shit given, people dislike him, insanely true/aware/honest to himself and follows his own heart/mind/intuition

Lisa was a failure, Mac was a failure- John wrote Ticket to ride I(Woz) wrote Apple II
Time magazine had a sculpture which was way before months in process you were never going to become Man of the year- Reality Distortion

Axe - creates oppurtunity; Monk like discipline; use fear- do everything or you might miss, use rage similarly; can't give in to feeling good, we have to win; Mad at Gordie, he didn't game it out, risk-reward ratio way off; coldhearted- no emotions, take a good last look and forget them, move the fuck on. Gordy school principal. Moves on- doesn't keep losers; always looking for win, creates oppurtunities(mettalica gig-> fake retirement-she doess what she wants-> retirement act to protect sell positions for insider trades, Donnie & Cancer treatment, sparton ives- larry arrested distressed situations, Penay, shovelling during childhood), does to feel great- only 1 life so do it all.; Short term vs longterm; Rage, grew in him- fuel; tough - bold; earlier boss he had no soul- decreased his bonus for no reason- founded Axe cap- every year that day buys him breakfast; 9/11 shorts; destroy anyone, comes his way(Taylor, Grigor, Rice-kid redemption, Eads-> Axe Hall)

Dangal- haryanvi- tough minded, daring, no limits; Not soft-delayed decision maker-not goal obsessed but tough/hard/Killer Instinct unlike Kendall Roy(Succession)

David Goggins- They weren’t motivated. They were driven.; I had the Rocky soundtrack on cassette and I’d listen to Going the Distance for inspiration. On long bike rides and runs, with those horns blasting in my brain, I’d imagine myself going through BUD/S, diving into cold water, and crushing Hell Week. I was wishing, I was hoping, but by the time I was down to 250, my quest to qualify for the SEALs wasn’t a daydream anymore.; The sympathetic nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. It’s bubbling just below the surface, and when you are lost, stressed out, or struggling, like I was when I was a down and out kid, that’s the part of your mind that’s driving the bus. We’ve all tasted this feeling before. Those mornings when going on a run is the last thing you want to do, but then twenty minutes into it you feel energized, that’s the work of the sympathetic nervous system. What I’ve found is that you can tap into it on-call as long as you know how to manage your own mind.; Similar to using an opponent’s energy to gain an advantage, leaning on your calloused mind in the heat of battle can shift your thinking as well. Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. And when you leverage a calloused mind like I did around the pool that day and keep fighting through pain, it can help you push your limits because if you accept the pain as a natural process and refuse to give in and give up, you will engage the sympathetic nervous system which shifts your hormonal flow.; I’m not suggesting you crawl up your own ass and bore your friends with all your stories about what a badass you used to be. Nobody wants to hear that shit. I’m talking about utilizing past successes to fuel you to new and bigger ones. Because in the heat of battle, when shit gets real, we need to draw inspiration to push through our own exhaustion, depression, pain, and misery. We need to spark a bunch of small fires to become the motherfucking inferno.

We didn’t care about muscle fatigue or breakdown because after a certain point we were training our minds, not our bodies. My workouts weren’t designed to make us fast runners or to be the strongest men on the mission. I was training us to take torture so we’d remain relaxed in extraordinarily uncomfortable environments.

I am not what i think i am, i am not what you think i am, i am what i think you think i am

Someone who has an edge: "I look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed, and logs onto a poker site so that he can pick off the U.S. drunks coming home on Saturday night. I hired a guy like that. He usually clears 5 or 10 grand every Sunday morning before breakfast taking out the drunks playing poker because they're not very good at it, but their confidence has gone up a lot." - Michael Platt, Bluecrest

Paranoia: "I want guys who when they put on a good trade immediately start thinking about what they could put on against it. They just have the paranoia." - Michael Platt, Bluecrest

there are three levels of consciousness at a baseline that is a follower a leader and an explorer so you can very easily classify people into life into these three categories people who follow who like like to follow something that makes sense to them people who like to lead people because that makes sense to them and then there are people who don't care about who's following or who's leading they're on their own trip right they're exploring explorating or exploring what it means to be themselves to be alive and to have a choice right so all human beings at various stages in their life are are existing in all these three spheres of following leading and exploring like even for example me every day i'm following someone i'm leading someone and i'm on my own trip as well i'm exploring so so it's like that so you shift consciousnesses



suddenly a whole like machine gun fire started on us accurate machine gun fire like you have to like hear it to experience it to understand what how chaos comes out of the darkness just boom accurate fucking buddy this big fucking bullets coming at you man bouncing off all of the fucking place at night so the whole team whole team i was in the lead group and uh though i like whole team went down whole team went down into the ground and there was like there was no space to hide there was no space to hide but you're like you just find that fucking space man like you know the fucking quarter centimeter you'll get into it right and i was just it it had just started and i was just looking i was also down all of us were down i just looked ahead and these two three guys had of me and i looked behind whatever till where i could see i could i could see whole column down and it's just started like two seconds into combat right two seconds into being ambushed we were ambushed so two seconds into that and uh i just thought at that point of time that the man who stands now and returns fire he's the leader the man who stands now stands now in that fucking hail of fucking machine gun fire who stands now and fucking gives it back because that's the only way you can stop that otherwise they'll keep fucking there no endless ammunition and soon you know rocket launchers will come and soon a lot of other fucking is going to follow right so the man who stands now is the fucking leader of this group so i stood up and i started fucking firing back and as i was firing back and i started seeing people started standing and fucking firing back giving fucking fucking back and that's how we controlled that situation 


some people's cores break and those are the ones that leave and the ones who are left with that pure core they become more powerful what do you mean well now you realize yourself now you are you are you know what you are you just look back at what you have gone through for this long period of time you know and then you realize that nothing is impossible nothing nothing nothing so that's the kind of realization which is the chief weapon of a special forces operator who knows it that all this i have gone through now you just like whatever man whatever whatever

Special forces- lead uncomfortable life, be comfortable with uncomfortable circumstances

certain kind of people who are at that consciousness level where they understand that the choice is theirs those are the kind of people we look for and the entire selection process is to be able to see uh whether that guy is like that or not so people are are are already like that so we choose from those people and the circumstances are such that all those people who are not already at that stage of making their own choices and sticking by them the rest of them just get out from there they get out very very quickly there are some who are more and more so we that's why it is a long process people have different levels of being able to make a choice we want the guys who can make the ultimate choice because they made it and they can stick by it even if you know yamaraja comes and stands in front of you'll tell a fucking put a bullet in you man get the fuck out of my way it's like that could you highlight

you learn a lot not only about special forces skill sets and things like that but also you learn you come to realize about yourself a lot what your body is capable of what your mind is capable of what your heart is capable of and what is there beyond when you give up when you when you just let it all go and you're hanging by that thread of choice because it's a choice you made so you're hanging by the thread of choice constantly there constantly there and when you when that choice is so strong and you remain there that's what we are looking for self uh an ability to make a choice for yourself and stick by it so that's what filters out in combat you know that's what we want in combat so when when combat is happening when bullets are flying bombs are exploding people are freaking dying killing each other all that shit is happening intense amount of chaos it's chaos the whole universe is gone it's just live you're there right so it's at that time there is immense amount of clarity or there will be an immense amount of confusion so that difference between immense amount of clarity and immense amount of confusion is based on how much of an ability to make a choice you have got so that we are able to determine during the probation process itself during the selection process itself we are able to determine that is this guy going to stick or is he go is he going to run we don't judge it it's okay to run or whatever it's natural but that's not what's going to work in combat man you know if you run you're weakening the the team itself so the team has to stand line up and fucking get into it so it has to be like that you have to go in rather than get out you have to go and penetrate reach tear it open and open it up and make it your own you make that space your own so so there are certain kind of people who are at that consciousness level where they understand that the choice is theirs those are the kind of people we look for
