What do i want to do in life?

I need to be the best in my field of interest, best among others. Right in the top 0.1% in world, considering people across all fields, across everyone.

I love to manage or start my own or otherwise anyone else's business, the topmost managing role. It's one of the prime reason I like the startups and its culture from the very beginning.

I love managing the business, improving and expanding it at the same time. To be able to create value for people alongwith the freedom to apply my own judgement towards innovation.

I think that's why i started learning coding to setup my "own" company, also developed interest in Finance into stock markets or Private Equity because such career choices offer me the freedom to manage the money(stock market- Portfolio Management) or business itself(Private Equity) by managing it effeciently.

In my opinion i love the excitement, challenges, obstacles, adventure to play around unlike the monotonous lifestyle that jobs entail.

So basic instinct behind all my interests is startinng my own company either as a Startup or after gaining appropriate experience my own Private Equity business post managing companies in some PE Firm.

The adrenalin and ecstacy i experience after contemplating about starting my own business or profession is what will help me succeed in my career, I have passion for business or managing other people's, this is what i love.

I think this is why i chose CA so that i will be able to gather skills about business management, understand the deep frameworks associated within businesses, able to comprehend properly, know all the loopholes and get well acquainted with them, to be able to better read businesses, etc.
