During bathing as opposed to pouring warm water over myself while applying soap I, this time, challenged myself to shut down the shower and while freezing up apply soap. Earlier the shower pressure wouldn't be high therefore very limited pressured water in limited quantity used to pour down.

However this time since i switched it off and after applying soap upon turning it back i experimented upon the knob and it turned out that the problem all this time was with the knob for slow pressure and not the shower system or geyser.

By doing something out of comfort zone, challenging myself not only i was bale to fulfill myself but also able to 'create' knew opportunities.
