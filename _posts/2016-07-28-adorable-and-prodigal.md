Not a day goes by when i look at a WagonR and i wish  its you sitting in front with your grand and adorable smile, your absurd feminine songs playing and your hysteric laughter. But as it is, I am always left with nothing but hope to see you someday.

Its been more than 10 years when i first saw you, even before you knowing my existence, at Palam Vihar. I was in 3rd standard back then and seeing you for the first time flushed away all my anxiety for my upcoming race, FYI: I had won my 1st ever Gold in my life, I didn't know your achievements and neither i knew your name but as they say, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever".

The next time we met was the 1st day at the Road, i was very shy to see so many better skaters than me. I saw you in your white t-shirt swinging all over the road, faster than anyone I could imagine, I don't think you noticed me but as far as i was concerned my morning rituals would be permanent now as i had got one more reason to betray my beloved sleep.

Back then during warm up runs with the others, all my attention was on that continuous hysterical laughter that still resonates you sitting next to me(Rohtak, 2012 State) while you teased me with Simran or Yuthika.

Do you remember the evening when we sere swaying over the rink(Hisar State 2012) and the word "Adorable" came up. I guess that is one of my favourite moments. I must have had blushed more than any other girl I had ever been with. Both us coyish and the interpretation of the undesirable word "Moti" had been changed to "Adorable".

In 2013 i turned out to be as you said "pathetic" and after going through those emails i cannot agree more with your perspective. I wish i could go back in time and rectify those brutal things i did to you. Maybe i freaked out after i said yes to you, maybe the fact of not seeing you frequently dawned upon me the idea to end it as soon as possible. Whatever it was all I can think right now is that "History repeats itself".

I don't know whether you remember 2012 RSFI state, road race, when I tried to propose you... Thinking about it now makes me embarrassed, how i tuned in the song "Just in Love" and gave you that paucious hint. For a few moments after realising , I think, you ignored me, and at that very moment I was literally abusing myself. That morning will forever be in me.

Being near you is same as Superman feels near the sun. I simply love to be near that hysterical laughter, spontaneous reactions, and when you suddenly  look at me. Whether it was that road journey to CBSE nationals 2012 when we slept on each other's shoulders or it was those Rohtak Practice sessions or the moment when we were coming  back in Simran's car watching 3 Idiot while the biggest idiot was sitting next to you in that cozy blanket, sitting next to you completed me. I felt secured, ambitious, maybe possessive too and much excited.

You may remember me as 'King of Ignore' but I'll always remember you as the 'Queen of Hearts'- adorable.

I can still recall that moment when we both fell while training at the KOD track, just two of us, how?, because my feet stuck together on the turn, you may recall all my falls were just because of that feet stuck, anyway I had been sitting on the pavement for about 5 mins, no one came to me to give cotton or some antiseptic solution but were attending you, and you noticed me,waiting for anyone yo do the honors, by the way I was pretty embarrassed that I led you down. And then you came to me and it was my left hand that you grabbed and very gently with your hands highlighted with your long nails glistening cleansed my bruises. For a moment I completely forgot the pain and was completely awestruck. I cannot ever forgot that face of yours, a little stressed but still with a smile.

The most overwhelming part of your smile are those two inscissors on the extreme sides that make you look like the cutest Drac.
