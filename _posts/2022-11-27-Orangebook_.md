4588. Ego is a reflection of your insecurities.
4589. Professionals are amateurs who believed in themselves for a long enough "time."

4594. "People who go furthest in life are those who aren?t scared of looking stupid: they keep asking questions, they keep self-reflecting, they keep learning."

4610. "In theory, anyone who starts with $1000 can become a billionaire in six months by playing on the financial markets. In practice, it's impossible. That's the gap between theory and practice. That's the gap between reading and doing. That's the gap between idea and execution."

4620. "You can be the kindest person in the world,  if you get wealthy and successful, you will inevitably attract haters,  because you remind them of who they subconsciously want to be, but are not."
4621. You are smart when you don?t get offended by the truth.
4622. "@Niravsays_ Thank you ! My personal journey will be disclosed in the book I'm currently working on. :-) It's taking more time than expected because I don't follow my own advice of not being too perfectionist, but I'm having fun, so it will be released once I'm fully satisfied. ??"

4647. You only understand what you truly want after you got what you thought you wanted.
4648. You can?t compete with people who only care about competing with themselves.
4649. What advice are you glad you never listened to?
4650. "Tip. When you talk to a stranger: assume they are potentially much more talented, much wealthier, much smarter than you. Many lack humility, and the wrong assumptions you make tell a lot about your level of maturity. Remember: successful people rarely show off their cards."

4655. It?s impossible to build a meaningful relationship with someone who lacks empathy and imagination.

4671. "If you are ever temporarily stuck with some obnoxious coworkers or family members, just consider it an opportunity to practice detachment and the art of not reacting."
4672. Happiness is just taking care of people you love who love you.
4673. "Good people don?t spend their time justifying why they?re good people. Talented people don?t spend their time showing off their skills. Wealthy people don?t spend their time boasting they have money. The desire to get validated conceals deeply hidden insecurities."
4674. "You will never think more clearly if you constantly keep yourself busy. Something like an hour-long walk every day should be a minimum."
4675. "Parents who supported you, or parents who belittled you, that's the difference between smart kids and insecure kids. Fortunately, anyone can unlearn and relearn anything even as an adult."
4676. Kids also learn faster because they don?t spend their time overthinking what they can or cannot do.
4677. "Don?t feel offended because no one cares about you, just become a more valuable person."
4678. @Darmorellarr9 Let?s go beyond the mere mathematical principle. It?s something to be experienced. There are many components of reality that do not follow linear rules. The growth of your mind is one of them. Keep a few effortful daily habits for a decade+. You go beyond all your expectations.
4679. Talent arises once you understand true learning and the power of compound interest.
4680. "Especially when looking back,  what most people call ?risky decisions? weren?t risky at all. We just grew too addicted to the illusions of stability and "comfort."

4683. The only one who can give you exactly the life you want is yourself.
4684. "If you feel judged by someone who doesn't even know you exist, the problem is your mind."
4685. "Jordan Peterson taught me that it doesn't matter how many millions of people you help out there, you will always have a silent crowd of unhappy people waiting for you to fail to show up and laugh. People who never once helped for free anyone at all, people who gave up long ago."
4686. "Best feelings in life: 1) When the dots suddenly connect, and you wonder why it took you so long to see the big picture 2) When your relationships are effortless, long-term, with kind  honest people 3) When you don't have to worry about money 4) When you understand yourself"
4687. "Nowadays, the scarcest traits are self-awareness and clarity of thoughts."
4688. "@coach_sachin I don?t even bother replying to these, I just block. There are a bunch of perspectives that take years to acquire and it?s not your responsibility to educate every single immature person out who won?t make the effort to listen. Especially when Twitter is full of nice people too."
4689. "If they lack logic, there?s no point to argue. If they are logical, there?s no need to argue. Many people out there are simply not aware of their own deficiencies, don?t get caught into foolish games."

4695. "@Sams_Antics I get your point. Imo a key element to ?get it? is language proficiency + sensitivity. There?s a lot of implicit and communication is partly based on ?reading the air? (?????). From conversations with long-term expats, I learned that some people feel ?off? even after years."
4696. "You don?t know ?what you would do if you were rich? until you get rich. Because the decade-long journey will completely change who you are. It?s easy to misjudge from the sidelines, you need skin in the game to understand."
4697. "Japanese people aren?t ?overly polite,? you just don?t share the same standards for respect and thoughtfulness, and it?s fine, but in life, you attract who you are, and long-term, you end up exactly with who you deserve."
4698. "@inmateLTU Thank you! Still never sent any email, sorry ?? Will just send one once the book is ready. Will announce it on Twitter anyway, but a mailing list is convenient in case you stop using Twitter but still remain interested by the upcoming book, or if my account gets suspended??"
4699. "If you grew up with smart, loving parents, you already had one of the biggest advantages in life."
4700. "@LegacyBuilder_ Few people understand that. Some people have their preconceptions about someone, a certain mental model, and whatever you say, they will focus on the negative, and assume you owe them an explanation, and if you reply something great, they just disregard it. (I block them btw.)"
4701. "The art of reading. Average: constantly listen to their inner voice, judge, "think" in terms of agree/disagree, try to "speed read" Educated: understand the background of the writer, put aside old beliefs, seek to understand new perspectives, re-read slowly, put in practice"
4702. "Financial freedom: 1) You don?t have to tolerate people you dislike 2) You have as much time as you want with your beloved 3) You have time to read and learn whatever you want 4) You have plenty of sleep, healthy food, workouts, rest 5) You can focus on building long-term"
4703. "You never see doers complain. You never see complainers do."
4704. "If you enjoyed it, it was time well-spent."
4705. You are the only person who remembers your embarrassing moments.
4706. "Never idolize anyone. The best never wanted to be idolized. They were just busy carving their own path."
4707. "A conversation should never be a contest to see who thinks faster.  It should be a dance.  Adjust yourself to your partner."
4708. "Every single successful person out there probably felt like giving up a hundred times before reaching their goal. Sometimes, you just gotta keep pushing, regardless of how you feel."
4709. "You become rich by owning an asset whose value keeps growing. That should include your mind."
4710. You regret 100% of the things you do when angry.
4711. @Charles1776USA Thank you ! ????
4712. "Reminders: 1) People barely have time to think about you, let alone your mistakes 2) Before criticizing your parents, picture yourself at their age with their experience 3) You won?t believe it until you do it, but you can learn way more than you think 4) Discipline is talent"
4713. "The fewer your opinions on everything, the better your results. The reason: success requires focus on your own work."
4714. Maybe time alone with a great book is the pill most need.
4715. "If you only learn from average people, don?t be surprised to get an average life."
4716. "Personal principle: only learn from people who have what you want. Money?  They better be financially free Fitness and nutrition?  They better be fit and healthy Love and friendship? They better be in happy long-term relationships Success? They better have remarkable results"
4717. "A great company: a group of talented individuals who would rather work alone unless they are surrounded by competent coworkers."
4718. "There are a lot of kind, great people out there. Don't lose faith because of a few angry people."
4719. "@7Y0ung That?s unfortunately a privileged position that most out there cannot have, because the parents themselves are clueless about it."
4720. "@va6va18 I'm not a conspirationist, but I'm pretty sure it's on purpose if you just connect the dots between governments, money, and the big industries out there."
4721. "Things school usually doesn't teach: - nutrition - kindness - self-reliance - mindfulness - relationships - healthy habits - love of reading - money / finance - emotional control - long-term thinking - importance of writing Fortunately, it's never too late to learn."
4722. "@Threeflea1 I've had the exact same thoughts. This pattern is pretty common from what I saw, struggling parents nurturing very smart kids, and vice-versa. Maybe an environment where they are surrounded by people more talented than them, and have to compete and grow to get what they want."
4723. "Funny how it works, in many cases, the luckier and comfier you were whilst growing up, the more entitled and the less grateful you feel. Some of the happiest people I know grew up in the middle of war and famine. Others almost died. There is no gratitude without perspective."
4724. "Success in five steps: 1) Believing in your growth potential 2) Cutting off unsuccessful naysayers 3) Years of struggles with little results 4) Dots start connecting, vision clarifies 5) Everything suddenly works out"

4727. "A sign of intelligence: You spend more time thinking about what you love than what you dislike."
4728. "It?s impossible to get wealthy if you keep a ?poor? mentality: hating the rich, stating life is unfair, complaining. In the past decade alone, an internet connection, English proficiency, and some curiosity, were all you needed to get rich. It will be the same for the 2020s."
4729. "Expect a lot from yourself, expect little from others, you will grow and be happy."
4730. "@cs_s0uM @agurlhasnoname9 I self-reflected about the pros and the cons, but I?ll never do it, not worth it. Even at this stage (~100k followers), I occasionally get threats and insults. Not foolish enough to ruin my life just to entertain people. I think it?s a powerful leverage, but I don?t need money."
4731. "@agurlhasnoname9 Yeah, a circle of close friends who are all working in different directions (Youtube, business, artist, MMA fighter, musician, ...) I choose people who take/took risks on purpose: they usually have the most interesting background stories, and we get along pretty well."
4732. "If you are scared of being hated, give up on success already. Attracting envy is inevitable when you're doing things right."
4733. "@BarbieDoll_2020 Yup! I also think most parents barely understand their own emotions, that?s why they can?t teach either."
4734. "Best things a parent can do for their kids: - being kind and loving to their spouse - being an intellectually curious role model, encouraging trial and error - listening and understanding, not lecturing - teaching them about money, emotions, health, principles - buying books"
4735. Only fools think that complaining and sharing their anger with others will improve things.
4736. "What?s one concept, idea, perspective, that you wish you had learned much earlier in life?"
4737. Entrepreneurs are just people who got tired of waiting for the perfect job.
4738. "@Anil_Jhb Oh btw, I know we all have life-constraints and we feel the need to learn ?fast,? but if you think long-term, it?s much more rewarding to have fun and take your "time." I don?t know how consciousness and the mind work, but I personally learn more efficiently if relaxed."
4739. "@Anil_Jhb It depends on you, and on what you do whilst watching/listening (notes-taking, pausing and reflect, etc.) I personally prefer books because I appreciate silence, but it?s a personal preference."
4740. "It?s a shame that as we grow up, most people no longer find the time to get absorbed into a great book for a few consecutive hours."
4741. "@jaapgrolleman My end goal is peace of mind. Anything that creates long-term anxiety or envy, like constantly watching successful people living their lives, is a no go. Key word is ?constantly,? it?s fine to be inspired once in a while. Walks are a great habit imo. Short answer: it depends."
4742. People care about your opinion only once it?s backed by results.
4743. You will always think you?ve missed an opportunity. Just focus on the next one.
4744. "Become the friend you wanna talk to. Become the spouse you wanna be with. Become the parent you wanted to grow up with. Become the child you wish you had. Become the mentor you never had. Become the creator of products you love. Become someone who lives on their own terms."

4754. "@in_saikat Replied elsewhere in the thread, we don't have the same definition of "educated." It's impossible to be truly educated without being humbled."
4755. "@mannythoughts12 The educated mind is calm. It understands itself, it is humble because it understands the true complexity of the reality. Many people think education is about credentials and status, but it?s hard to blame them for being misled."
4756. "If you enjoy seeing people fight with each other, you are not happy."
4757. @MaxPetitgenet My definition of an educated mind isn?t the popular one. I can frame it this way: "you aren?t educated as you as long you aren?t calm and self-understanding."
4758. Ego disappears once you are educated.
4759. "@SakiSamoa7 I?ve learned that it?s often a bad idea to try to guess the top ?? But yeah, I think we are about to have immense structural changes when it comes to the whole financial system. We?ll look back in two decades thinking it was obvious; right now is the time for educated bets."

4769. "@Mitch198509 I think it's easy to get caught into the games of society we're all playing and forget what truly matters and what doesn't really matter. Once it's clearer, you can focus your time and attention on what will bring you peace."
4770. "@Mitch198509 I personally suddenly leveled up after I almost died last year ?? It's basically about perspective. A good understanding of the context of your life helps. Plenty of ways to achieve that: practicing mindfulness, writing about yourself, talking to the previous generations..."

4778. "It's simple. If you are surrounded by happy, smart, kind people, you are doing things right. If not, spend more time on self-reflection and figure out how you can change. Because whether that's comfortable to hear or not, your relationships reflect who you are."

4809. "The only opinions worth listening to are those that are backed with results. The rest is noise. Prove yourself first if you want to get anyone?s attention."

4831. "@moabiuwa Better be happily single than fomo-ing into a relationship you feel unsure about. I'm gonna sound a bit brazen here, but from personal observations, I saw many women who thought they'd get a loving husband, who ended up with another boy they have to take care of for decades."
4832. "@SinnUndSubstanz Thanks for the kind words! :-) I think writing shouldn't be forced.

6408. "Anyone healthy, confident, fit, happy is attractive. To be healthy, sleep well, eat well. To be confident, make more efforts, grow your talents. To be fit, hit the gym, fast regularly. To be happy, stay mindful, connect with kind, honest, driven people, keep learning."
6409. "I?m wary of the unconfident who never got hit on. What happens when someone much smarter and good-looking than your current partner starts flirting? Loyalty is an asset mostly owned by the self-confident, who are used to optionality, who take responsibility for their choices."
6410. "Two people who can?t handle aloneness can never make a happy couple. Many end up staying together as a habit, not because they are truly thrilled by each other anymore. The best relationships are made out of minds striving for personal growth, not out of convenience."
6411. Growth starts when you realize no one cares about you and your mistakes.

6422. "Money doesn't buy happiness directly, but it certainly helps to be able, to travel and open up your mind, to not worry about food, rent, bills, to go to higher-end social events, to be able to take entrepreneurial risks, to cut off relationships you don't need, to relax."
6423. "Start a company even if you are not the best innovator. Write a book even if you are not the best thinker. Invest money even if you are not the most knowledgeable. Live abroad even if you don't speak the language. No struggle, no growth. Dare to fail."

6432. Your life gets better once you stop paying attention to the lives of others getting better.
6433. "School conditioned us all to believe life was a race. Learning fast to compete in exams. Writing fast to publish prolifically. Talking fast to look smart. Life is not a race. Learn at your own pace. Publish when your work is ready. Talk slowly as long as it's clear."
6434. "@FilioProdigal Thank you ! ???? Twitter is time-consuming enough already. I prefer to focus on one platform and do things well.?? I mostly write for my own pleasure and further constraints would be detrimental. (I have an inactive Instagram account for some people who wanted to tag me.)"
6435. "Years of rejection seem to be a prerequisite to success. Years of efforts seem to be a prerequisite to self-confidence. Years of writing seem to be a prerequisite to clear thinking. Years of solitude seem to be a prerequisite to healthy relationships."
6436. "Many writers are stuck in self-censorship. "Everything that needs to be written, has already been written, and by better writers than I." This is false. If your words can benefit even one soul out there, you should do it. Build a writing habit. It will change your life."
6437. @srowlands And it simultaneously creates businesses.
6438. "It's normal to cringe when you read what you wrote a few years ago. It?s normal to cringe when you remember what you did a few years ago. It's normal to cringe when you think about who you were a few years ago. Cringing is healthy. A sign of growth."

6445. "Seventy years ago, in 1950, there were also many rich investors, many good-looking, famous entertainers, models, singers, comedians, athletes, envied by many for their glamorous lives. The common point? They are all dead. You are alive. Stop paying attention to the noise."

8236. "Idealization ends mimetic growth. When lost, find a model. Someone happy, smart, kind, honest, with a lovely family, rich, fit, funny... Anything you want to pretend to. But don?t fool yourself into thinking they?re flawless. Love yourself more than any idea of any guru."

8245. "You are free to disagree with anything, but the goal should always be learning, and to grow, and to live a happier life, and respect will get you much further."

8247. "@BobMadalle That?s a solution, but it takes much more time and it?s pretty wasteful in terms of efforts. The only constraint is often financial ? we can?t stop running, and we are too exhausted during weekends to even think about what we should or shouldn?t do to grow into a better self."
8248. "@Ymindel Also the reason why teaching to think is so hard: scarcity of teachers. Most don?t have the necessary contrast (through personal change) and empathy to imagine how students struggle when the foundations are nonexistent."

8401. "@NanavatyRahul Agreed! But many people have no idea why their lives ?feel wrong? and are surrounded by others who don?t know either. Uneducated and angry family constantly arguing  gossiping. No defined values. Brainwashed. Lost. For them, the Internet gives access to broader perspectives."
8402. "@trimmer30_98 Fair point. Any tool can either empower or enslave. But at least, it?s leveling out the access to opportunities and knowledge."

8424. "You can be attractive, fit, rich, with a loving family, full of knowledge  achievements, and still depressed. You can be poor, ignorant, a few limbs missing, and wake up everyday with a smile. It always sounds obvious  repetitive but: it?s about perspective  gratitude."
8425. "Don?t use reading as an escape, but as the key to understand and dissipate the harmful cloud of doubts."

8427. Pessimism is the acquired ability to invent problems where there are none.
8428. "You only run out of ideas if the foundations of your mind were clumsily architectured. The existing core, if well-designed from the start, can always expand in new directions. If not, only courage is required to pay no heed to the eyes of others, and do what you need to do."
8429. "Arrogance is sometimes attractive, but rarely to the right people."

8449. @deseanchin02 Reading is always selective.
8450. "It takes efforts from the few to move the lives of the many; but it takes efforts from the many for the few to get the time to make the move. Be grateful if you?re in a position to think and build. Too many ?intellectuals? look down on those stuck in a 9-to-5 job."
8451. The biggest library in the world is useless if disordered. Knowledge is similar.

8491. You miss the present when you?re scared of missing it.
8492. "A video of your parents isn?t your parents. The recorded song isn?t the live performance. The picture of the fireworks isn?t the fireworks. If you think you can capture the past, and relive it anytime, you miss the richness of the present."

8508. "People?s mental models are software, but you interact from a guest account: You can?t install updates. Stop trying."
8509. "Most people have never spent time alone. Time spent behind a book or a screen is not time spent alone. You need to contemplate your own thoughts  your desire to socially bond. That?s the only way to understand them and learn what true focus is."
8510. "@lennywhipshake @snumanali We actually agree. There?s no fight once you?ve figured out a lifestyle where they don?t even arise anymore. An intelligent mind figures out its own mechanisms, and optimizes through physical actions what it thinks it needs. Ruthlessness actually implies no struggle."

8517. "A lot of people seem to think that there's a magic pill out there that will solve all their worries, a magic book that will make them smarter, or a magic workout program that will make them fit. If magic exists, it's called long-term focused efforts."
8518. "Read the best books several times. The first time, you hear. The second time, you understand. The third time, you learn. The fourth time, you think. After enough reading, the first reading of any book feels like its fourth."

8550. All the theoretical knowledge and books in the world are useless if you are unable to act when opportunity arises.
8551. "@Simon_O_Regan As long as you try to copy someone else, you are always at least one step behind. The most successful people don?t try to become the next anybody else. They leveraged their own background, dug further into the unknown, understood the recent trends, and combined them all."
8552. "When it comes to leveraging your knowledge, become a monopoly: someone so unique that no one has a chance to capture the value you create."

8566. The most life-changing book you will ever read is the one you write yourself.

8568. "Too much time is wasted on finding a purpose before acting. Your whole narrative is based on nothing. Money, career  ideals only exist in our collective minds. We invent new goals as we go. Not serving any purpose is fine. That?s how nature works. But it makes life more fun."

8613. "If inflation is a silent thief, then sugar is a silent killer."

9392. "In a constantly accelerating society, patience is an undervalued skill. Look back on all your impulsive decisions  see how the outcome could have been different with more time allocated to waiting efficiently. The best results yield from years or even decades of patience."

9403. "It?s not *your* husband/wife/children. Not *your* money. You are neither a job nor a belief: The more you assimilate yourself to a possession, the more likely you are to be disappointed when you inevitably need to part ways. Life itself is temporarily borrowed."

9412. "Clarity of mind naturally appears once illusions  lies have disappeared. That may be the reason why integrity  honesty are two common traits of the greatest thinkers. You can?t think clearly as long as you?re fooling yourself."

9426. "The first step to fight depression is to acknowledge that you are depressed. You can go through a lifetime thinking it?s your natural state. You can believe it?s an ineluctable fate. Or you can fight back. Overcoming depression is in the attempt  the seemingly benign factors."
9427. "Was watching some old photos with my family. You realize how everyone will be forgotten in a few generations. How what seemed incredibly important not so long ago has faded away.  also how breathtaking it is to be able to digitally store  share information across the world."
9428. "Don?t try to reiterate older people?s successes: in most cases, their opportunities are gone, and you live in a different technological era with new ones.  Just surround yourself with those who possess the traits you yearn for."
9429. "The most curious individuals I know easily get bored. They switch from one activity to another with no remorse. But there is one constant when they don?t: when the said activity is reading. You can?t get bored when you have an infinity of minds to explore."
9430. "?In his youth, Albert Einstein spent a year loafing aimlessly.  You don't get anywhere by not 'wasting' time: something, unfortunately, that the parents of teenagers tend frequently to forget.? ? Carlo Rovelli"

9436. "Don?t focus on how people should behave with you. Focus on whether you behave according to your own principles. Self-improvement starts with conscientiousness, yet the very moment we need to be mindful, emotions  instinctive reactions tend to cloud our good judgment."
9437. "The only sustainable relationships are those based on trust,  and they only happen when both sides possess the common core value of honesty. Manipulative people will drain your energy  destroy your principles."

9440. "@42e40bfb Aside from processed meat, it?s the main component of my diet (mainly chicken + salmon/mackerel). The important part is intermittent fasting imo, which I couldn?t effectively do while my insulin resistance was high: hunger was an issue, hence the switch to low carb)."
9441. "A career shouldn?t be a cage: don?t lock yourself up in a false sense of security. Whether you clearly see it or not, there is always a price to pay. Don?t sacrifice freedom  joy for conformity  boredom."
9442. "Modeles of failure are underrated. Take a look at those who never achieved anything  avoid their path. In that category, you have people who only speak up to approve/disapprove everything,  yet never had the courage to take a single initiative nor ever added any value."
9443. "Maybe one day, intermittent fasting and restriction of carbs will be greatly democratized. Everyone will feel lighter, sharper  less depressed. Everyone will be wondering how they could be foolish enough to eat three times a day. I personally wish I had known this sooner."
9444. "Your mind is constantly judging, criticizing  comparing. Yet, as long as thoughts are in the way, you never truly pay attention. Attention is only achieved when focus works in synergy with awareness."

9450. "If you surround yourself with low in energy, moody  overall negative people, don?t be surprised if you can?t find peace in your daily life. Cutting off toxic people is easy once you realize there are plenty of honest, kind  positive people: You just need to make some space."
9451. "Sometimes, you just need to learn to let go of some people. You are not meant to be in their life  they are not meant to be in yours. And it's perfectly fine. No need to feel bad about it.  The world is vast enough for anyone to find adequate companions for their own journey."
9452. @Complexity_Labs Seems like linear thinkers are preponderous in academia.
9453. "Stop asking people what they think about anything. Grow some self-confidence, endure short-term pain, aim for long-term goals, take risks  keep moving forward. Satisfaction comes from being an independent thinker. And the only impartial judge is "time."

9455. "Words are both one of the most lethal weapons  a potential miraculous solution for all our issues. Use them the right way and you can: ? manipulate life itself (DNA) ? create paradigm shifts for mankind (software) ? control people like pawns in a chess game (media/beliefs)"

9458. "?You don't have to add anything in order to be happy; you've got to drop something.  [Life]?s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings.  Do you know where these things come from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!? ? Anthony de Mello"
9459. "Don?t burn the whole forest just because one tree is toxic. Don?t blame an entire group for the misdeeds of the few. Don?t skip the whole book because a few pages are ?boring?. Don?t cower in fear when you fail several times in a row: the chances of success may be independent."
9460. "?Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty.  Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.? ? Franz Kafka"
9461. "Don?t blame your parents for your education: you can learn A LOT from incompetent parents. It?s about how you position yourself once independent: a fatalistic victim? a responsible adult?.. and how you take advantage of a blessed digital era where knowledge is no longer scarce."

9467. "Life is complicated enough as it is: no need to add the challenge of keeping track of all your lies. Yet, that?s what you do when you throw away your integrity  cover innocence and authenticity by layers of self-deception. Full potential is on the path of your bliss."

10014. "5) We live in a society where reputation is becoming increasingly important. How you act hidden behind a computer screen exposes your position towards self-respect. Changing habits is hard. Authenticity can be your greatest weapon. Or your demise, depending on your quintessence."
