Force=Mass\*Acceleration Motivation= f(Speed,Direction{Reason, intent behind it, why?}) Focus=M{Remaining in focus, \[intent,reason,why doing it\]} \* A{right direction and right speed} Don't stop or get distracted, equivalent to breaking-stoping car in middle and then starting off again, discourse and requirement to re-accelerate.

As Elon Musk said, use the basic fundamental truths and common sense, reasoning and apply it to other branches of knowledge as well as think over it, tinker with them more, trying to comeup possible more interpretations and applications of it and expand the semantic tree of knowledge-wisdom for yourself.

Here using basic Physic principles, one can treat Motivation and Focus as "forces", forces behind hard-work, where F=MA, hence we get above representations.
