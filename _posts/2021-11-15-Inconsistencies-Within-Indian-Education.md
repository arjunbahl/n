# **"Inconsistencies Within Indian Education"**

* * *

## Backstory:

Recently All India CBSE Board Results were declared. Me and my friends all got some good marks but something caught my  eye, everyone of us had atleast 2 subjects with same marks(exactly same). I was intrigued so i crawled CBSE website and downloaded their result database. And Did Some Analysis.....Quite Intriguing Time!

Important Scenarios That Inspired Me:

- [CutOff Of St.Stephens](http://www.ststephens.edu/admissions/cutoff-2015.htm): "98%, 99%, what is going on? Then it was this that frustrated me more than anything else, [CutOffs may rise even more...](http://www.hindustantimes.com/higherstudies/high-class-12-scores-increasing-applications-may-raise-cut-offs/article1-1359572.aspx)"
    
    > "The reason is the impressive board results and many students have passed with high marks."
    
- Seriously? High marks? No they were blatant giveaways....

* * *

### So i started my analysis.

The following graph illustrated as well as proved how educated and knowledgeable our friends really are:

But wait not only the above illustrates how the number "95" was the giveaway of May 20th but also highlights the _INCONSISTENT_ marking/evaluation mechanism.

As you see the frequency is more than 33.33% for getting exactly 95 in your subjects. Obviously there is something wrong with current marking mechanism or examiners.

## Let's Look At Some More Data....

## Consequences

Most of us might be wondering why it is much of a deal, _why getting 95's is not good?_ Simple answer is "**LOW SUPPLY**", in economic terms _demand is high for good universities but presence of such colleges or universities are much more less._ DELHI UNIVERSITY, has _77_ colleges accommodating _54000_ seats. But wait number of applicants is over 290,000. So that means every 1 in 6 will get a seat in DU? NO! With above data where every 1 in 3 subjects getting exactly 95, there is minuscule chance that you will get into the one of the best universities even after scoring very good 90%+. We live in a society with "Herd Mentality" and obviously most of us and our parents are concerned more about our neighbor's marks or his/her colleague's child. Such cases increase expectation from the child, since class 12 board exams are given utmost superiority and focus, such unfair results can often crash the mental balance of a student and cause acute depression or demotivation. The already skytouching cutoffs at Delhi University, one of the prominent universities in India, have cutoffs mainly between 93-100%. After the above analysis its no longer a doubt for such extreme cutoffs. Average students are not able to get into such universities and are often forced and exploited in private universities where not cutoffs but fees touch sky. **Playing with our answersheets is not at all justifiable and neither is playing with our lives and more importantly, are future.** We spend 2 million minutes of our lives studying in extreme conditions for what, this busted result? NO!

Thanks

And Live Prosperous!
