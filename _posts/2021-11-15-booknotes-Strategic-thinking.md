Notes -- Thinking Strategically


1. Hot hand:
    * P(basket | previous missed shot) > P(basket | previous basket)
    * No hot hand but hot player could be there, however opponent players focus on him therefore other team players are better off thus team wins is better estimator for HH

2. Follow the crowd: "Yatch race wherein US(leader) didn't shift to the side where 2nd in lead was, as wind provided assistance on 2nd player's side US lost the race"
    * Sometimes its better to follow your own path/choices (eg. Apple Steve Jobs, Google, Elon Musk), information advantage/arbitrage

3. Prisoner's Dilemma

4. Intransigence: "make or break"

5. Bell the cat: "prisoners dilemma (n>2), who will go first"


6. Look before you leap: "Apple ecosystem, airlines frequent flier"

7. Mix your plays: "Randomness in actions/choices sequence"

8. Even bet advantage: "t-1000/700; payoff at t+1 is y => a should bet what b does so 300 diff remains constant no matter what"
