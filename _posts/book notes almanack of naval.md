You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.


Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.


Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.


Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling


Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.


Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.


Specific knowledge is found by pursuing


your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.


Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.


Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
Find a Position of Leverage3 highlights


One form of leverage is labor—other humans working for you.


It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. [78]


The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code.
Get Paid for Your Judgment1 highlight


Imagine someone comes along who demonstrably has slightly better judgment. They’re right 85 percent of the time instead of 75 percent. You will pay them $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, whatever it takes, because 10 percent better judgment steering a $100 billion ship is very valuable. CEOs are highly paid because of their leverage. Small differences in judgment and capability really get amplified. [2]
Prioritize and Focus3 highlights


There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.


Advice to a young engineer considering moving to San Francisco: “Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?”


Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count. [7]
How to Think Clearly4 highlights


It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. [7]


Very smart people tend to be weird since they insist on thinking everything through for themselves.


A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform.


Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.
Happiness Is Learned5 highlights


The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all duality and polarity. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.


The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto a feeling, if I say, “Oh, I’m happy now,” and I want to stay happy, then I’m going to drop out of that happiness.


Happiness is what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life.


If you look at little children, on balance, they’re generally pretty happy because they are really immersed in the environment and the moment, without any thought of how it should be given their personal preferences and desires.
Success Does Not Earn Happiness2 highlights


Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.


Confucius says you have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one. When and how did your second life begin?
