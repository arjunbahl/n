I saw him gasping for every breathe, putting up a fake smile as he turned to all of us to greet. Confusion ensued whether we should be grateful or him as it's neither easy for the person suffering nor the silent observers. Slowly as he chimed towards the sofa at the end it felt an eternity passed by. His eyes gazed at the floor in pain, i could see no hope. All we wanted was the time to quickly fly by so we could skip the pain and misery. We weren't looking for peace, we just wanted the absence of pain. Hope was a luxury.<br /><br />In that densely occupied room none of us cared for the world outside. All that mattered was in front of us, lying on the sofa assisted by a ventillator, making sure not to disappoint us, smiling when he didn't want to, laughing just to give us company but never complained about the pain nor shared the questions he had. We had the same questions, why him, an orphan by accident, now an integral part of our loving family. He didn't deserve to get separated from his biological parents, it seemed deja vu had striked him only this time they were his adopted parents being separated, gradually.<br /><br />Hopelessness was all around him yet he participated in collectiveness. I saw true selflessness that day.<br /><br />None of us knew how to deal with this situation, how to console a dying boy. All the education, awareness, knowledge, skills and thinking prowess faded away against death. An unfair life for him, tragedy for us. What could we do.<br /><br />While one of ours was dying every second, losing his precious time another young boy, who was completely oblivious to the gruesome circumstances, was the life of the room. Playing around with family members, poking the dog, full of life. What a dichotomous room it was. Difference between life and death so stark and close in front of us, we appreciated life even more that day. I hope the boy did too, hope he had fun and happy memories to part with, i hope he too loved his time spent, i know he would choose life over death every single time if he had a choice. <br /><br />I hope he finds a better and a peaceful place soon. I hope he remebers us, because we will, forever.
