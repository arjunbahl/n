Today while surveying market for Exterior tiles for our home we got in touch with a woman at a tile store. Unlike other owners she was very passionate about the product being sold by her, was very knowledgeable, confident, humble in dealing with us. She knew what we needed more than us, she aligned our opinions with the best. She guided us throughout, cleared all doubts not by merely imposing her opinions on us but rather by showing us, demonstrating us the "why" instead of arguing with us.

She went through our mind, finding what we are looking for without wasting anytime, she knew what she had, infact she was so confident that she had a piece while the workmen denied its stock and later on eventually they did upon her insisting. That's passion.

Unlike other owners who "simply" demonstrate via their workmen or employees she was as much involved with us as we could be. Always providing us with varied choices and based upon our feedback she would instantly command her employees to show us another batch. She was engrossed in the process.

She was managing the floor very well, knew how to get work done efficiently and quickly without any delay.

She had huge variety in her forte of products, infact after surveying all main markets in Gurgaon including Sikanderpur we were surprised that no one had the kind of variety she had and that's what customers would love in a shop - one place for the product they're after.

The reason we found her better was because of her value additions, mostly in the form of her experienced and sensible recommendations and guidance for us.

She wasn't buttering our asses and this genuineness of her is what we were admiring, she kept our interest before hers- satisfying our needs before closing her sale.
