Don't skip sleep altogether so that you are able to sleep next night at time, rather sleep for say 2-3 hrs(4AM to 7AM) and stay awake afterwards, you won't be groggy infact rather active.

Key is to manage(what you want from what is at hand, being effective and effecient), sleep a few hours to not feel groggy and use the deficiency of sleep later at night, instead of "trying" to be awke for whole night and following whole day of which past experience is nothing more than a failure, it is not effective and effecient way to achieve desired goals i.e resync sleep cycle since we fall asleep after pulling whole night and unable to get "some" rest, we fall asleep and don't get up after a nominal time period rather a whole cycle(8-10hrs) of sleep gets induced.

 

Also having slept during late evening or early night maybe till say 1AM or so helps to change the sleep time for body atleast if not the waking time.

 

During Covid19, post Deloitte: Awake whole night, continued this to next day, engaged in numerous activities such as mopping, laptop, etc. Drank espresso to continue being awake till evening, slept in evening at around 7-730. Woke up next morning at around 5. Continued this for sometime and sleep cycle got reset.
