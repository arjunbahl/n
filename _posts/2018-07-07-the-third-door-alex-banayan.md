Pick up the damn phone

1. Bill Gates was nineteen years old when MITS released the world's first minicomputer kit. Bill and his best friend
2. Paul Allen wrote a letter to the founder of MITS, offering to sell software to run it. When they didn't receive a reply, they debated how to follow up.
3. Bill handed the phone to Paul. third doorPenguin Random House
4. "No, you do it!" Paul said. "You're better at this kind of thing."
5. "I'm not going to call," Bill shot back. "You call!"
6. I guess even the person destined to be the world's richest man suffered from paralyzing fear. Eventually, they came up with a compromise—Bill would call, but say he was Paul.
7. The founder of MITS was receptive and said they could come out to their office in New Mexico to demo the software. Bill was overjoyed. He had only one problem—he didn't actually have any software.
8. After eight long weeks, Bill and Paul finished the software. When Paul arrived at MITS headquarters, he took a breath, loaded it, and . . . it worked. Paul and Bill closed the deal, signed the contract, and that's how they sold their first piece of software.
9. One lesson stands out among the rest. Although his talent for coding was remarkable, none of this would have happened if Gates hadn't pushed through his fears in his dorm room, picked up the phone, and called MITS. It was his ability to do the hard, uncomfortable thing that made this opportunity possible.
10. The potential to unlock your future is in your hands — but first you have to pick up the damn phone.
11. Ask yourself: What's the one thing that you're afraid of doing right now that you know can change the course of your career? Can you schedule one hour in your calendar tomorrow to push through that fear and, in your own way, pick up the damn phone?

Offer to help with their taxes

1. When Warren Buffett finished undergrad, he was working as a stockbroker. Though nearly every time Buffett tried to get a meeting with a businessperson in Omaha, he was turned down.
2. No one wanted to meet with a young guy with no credibility trying to sell them stocks.
3. So Buffett changed his approach—he began calling businesspeople and made them feel he could save them money on their taxes. All of a sudden the businesspeople said, "Come on in!"
4. Just like that, Buffett booked his meetings.
5. The lesson here is that just because people won't meet with you for the reason you want, that doesn't mean they won't meet at all. Just find another angle. Figure out what they need and use that as your way in. Be honest: Are you facing the kind of rejections where you can't understand why the other person won't take your meeting? What's that person's equivalent of "helping them with their taxes" that will get them to say "come on in"?

Be your own manager

1. When Lady Gaga was in New York City trying to launch her career, she had a problem. She was relatively unknown and had trouble getting local venues to book her to perform.
2. So she used the money she made as a waitress and went to a print shop to make big posters of herself. Then she plastered them right in front of the bars and clubs where she wanted to perform. All of a sudden, the venue bookers took her calls.
3. But when she wanted to negotiate better set times, she faced resistance. So she called the bars, changed her voice, and said "This is Lady Gaga's manager" and that Gaga only performed at the ten o'clock slot.
4. It worked.

The lesson is to stop waiting in hopes that other people will recognize your talent. Be your own manager. Be your own publicist. Stop waiting for someone to choose you—and start choosing yourself.

Be real: If you had a world-class manager focused on propelling your career right now, what would be the biggest thing you'd ask that manager to do? What's stopping you from doing it yourself? Making your choice

When Bill Gates sat in his dorm room and pushed through his fear to pick up that phone, that was a choice. When Lady Gaga plastered those posters in front of the nightclubs, that was a choice.

Over the past seven years, I've learned that everyone has the power to make little choices that can alter their lives forever.

You can either choose to continue waiting in line for the First Door—or you can choose to jump out of line, run down the alley, and take the Third Door.
