## Summary
1. Problem = Data + condition + unknown
2. Find similar problem solved in past with exact unknowns. If unable to find one with exact unknowns then try to find one with similar unknowns.
3. Create similar problems with simpler versions (n dimensional to 2 dimensional)
4. Generalised problems are more easily solvable than specific ones. Avoids complex calculations & unnecessary unknowns. (Line + plane + octahedron cutting through => line + plane + any solide)
5. 
* Thinking:
    * Incomplete understanding woing to lack of concentration. 
* Doing:
    * Rushing into calculations without general plan or waiting clumsily for an idea to come
* Verifying:
    * Check/verify results at frequent steps




___

Incomplete understanding of the problem, owing to lack of concentration, is perhaps the most widespread deficiency in solving problems. With respect to devising a plan and obtaining a general idea of the solution two opposite faults are frequent. Some students rush into calculations and constructions without any plan or general idea; others wait clumsily for some idea to come and cannot do anything that would accelerate its coming. In carrying out the plan, the most frequent fault is carelessness, lack of patience in checking each step. Failure to check the result at all is very frequent; the student is glad to get an answer, throws down his pencil, and is not shocked by the most unlikely results.


You do not take up a problem, unless it has some interest; you settle down to work seriously if the problem seems instructive; you throw in your whole personality if there is a great promise. If your purpose is set, you stick to it, but you do not make it unnecessarily difficult for yourself. You do not despise little successes, on the contrary, you seek them: "If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem."


### The more general problem may be easier to solve. This sounds paradoxical but, after the foregoing example, it should not be paradoxical to us. The main achievement in solving the special problem was to invent the general problem.
Find a plane that passes through the given line and bisects the volume of the given octahedron.” This problem may look difficult but, in fact, very little familiarity with the shape of the regular octahedron is sufficient to suggest the following more general problem: "“A straight line and a solid with a center of symmetry are given in position. Find a plane that passes through the given line and bisects the volume of the given solid.” The plane required passes, of course, through the center of symmetry of the solid, and is determined by this point and the given line. As the octahedron has a center of symmetry, our original problem is also solved."
The reader will not fail to observe that the second problem is more general than the first, and, nevertheless, much easier than the first. In fact, our main achievement in solving the first problem was to invent the second problem. Inventing the second problem, we recognize the role of the center of symmetry; we disentangled that property of the octahedron which is essential for the problem at hand, namely that it has such a center.



If you cannot solve the proposed problem do not let this failure afflict you too much but try to find consolation with some easier success, try to solve first some related problem; then you may find courage to attack your original problem again. Do not forget that human superiority consists in going around an obstacle that cannot be overcome directly, in devising some suitable auxiliary problem when the original one appears insoluble.



When Archimedes found the area of the surface of the sphere he did not know, as we just mentioned, any formerly solved problem having the same unknown. But he knew various formerly solved problems having a similar unknown. There are curved surfaces whose area is easier to obtain than that of the sphere and which were well known in Archimedes’ time, as the lateral surfaces of right circular cylinders, of right circular cones, and of the frustums of such cones. We may be certain that Archimedes considered carefully these simpler similar cases. In fact, in his solution, he uses as approximation to the sphere a composite solid consisting of two cones and several frustums of cones
### If we are unable to find a formerly solved problem having the same unknown as the problem before us, we try to find one having a similar unknown. Problems of the latter kind are less closely related to the problem before us than problems of the former kind and, therefore, less easy to use for our purpose in general but they may be valuable guides nevertheless. 
### Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.
