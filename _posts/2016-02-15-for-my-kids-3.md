The feeling of earning money is something compared to eternity for me. Kids for me the most joyous moment is when I make money. Today I came back from my CA classes via public auto which costed me Rs.20 for over 6-7 kms. As they say a penny saved is a penny earned. Not that your Dadu or Dadi has made some constrains on my finances rather it's purely my own wish. Saving even Rs.20 which would have been consumed if I had taken a direct bike taxi to home rather than walking around a km. You see moments like these grow you up. Moments like these motivate you to fight harder, sacrifice more, work hard than ever. I hope you understand the value of money well.

Till then and forever..... Your admirer Dad
