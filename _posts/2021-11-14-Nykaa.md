# Valuation
1. "Nykaa" at 2500 crore sales is valued at 95k cr (40 times sales). Marico at quarterly sales of 2500 crore is valued at 70k crore ( 7 times sales, 10k annual revenue) and looks expensive too
2. Market cap ~$12.5B
3. Sales 0.4B out of 30B [[Industries-view.cosmetics]] ~ 1% of market
* Caveat: "Nykaa" is more like an aggregator than a cosmetics company though they have their own line.
