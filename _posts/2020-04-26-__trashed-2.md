Â 

I started my academic career at Penn or as an undergraduate I worked on the first large-scale treebank project to collect annotated natural language texts for research you see back in the 1980s and 1990s we didn't have data and computers were really slow we didn't even really have the internet yet at least not as we know it today so if you wanted data that was clean enough and voluminous enough to do AI research he had to spend research money collecting it manually and then annotating it manually in fact what we call deep learning today which seems to solve every problem Under the Sun was just called neural networks back in the night 80s and 90s and we rejected it as a failure the only problem with neural nets was that computers were too slow and there wasn't nearly enough data available to train them properly we spent two decades trying to work around those problems and we did a meritorious job but if we just waited for more data and faster computers we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble I got my PhD at Stanford although I didn't spend much time there there were a lot of theoretical AI researchers and a lot of lots of entrepreneurs entrepreneurialism but they didn't overly overlap much since I wanted to do practical applied research for my PhD I ended up going to IBM Research to do my thesis work I worked in the IBM speech recognition group where they seemed to be doing sorry I seem to be they seem to be doing cutting-edge research on real world problems at least they seem to be and they were to agree degree and I learned an enormous amount about AI to do about how to do great AI work there but ultimately because of the state of computer

it's always important have a good technical team so ultimately so I figured IBM research ultimately because of the state of computers and data they were doing state-of-the-art research but on necessarily toy problems well I finished my PhD research to senior managers from the IBM group decided to do something actually useful with what they learned at IBM they left to go work at Renaissance Technologies a quantitative quantitative trading firm founded by a world-class mathematician Jim Simons

they eventually dragged a bunch of the more useful members of the IBM research group to join them including myself at Renaissance I learned what it meant to write code that actually did things in the real world under Peter Browns guidance I was a lead architect of the equities trading platform which was no small feat in 1995 since computerized trading wasn't really a thing yet the testament to the design principles we use then is that the basic structure of the trading system that we developed in the late 1990s is still in use today

at IBM I learned important lessons about practical and impractical applications of AI we had an extraordinary team of scientists from a broad set of disciplines computer science mathematics physics information theory statistics and we were trying to solve real world problems to build computer systems that could transcribe speech or translate text from one language to another but there was something inherently impractical about what we were doing so we were trying to build speech recognition systems when in fact the computers were too slow and storage was too big and expensive and there wasn't enough data to really succeed in fact we used a roomful of computers to do tasks that we now do on our phones and in the cloud we also tried to build machine translation systems when it turned out that the traditional solutions were enough for the customers who bought them and it really surprisingly reducing error rates from the a I actually made end to end translation worse since the human translators who are editing the output of the AI had a harder time correcting less error-prone trick prone translations we were inventing complex solutions to difficult problems that disappeared when computers got faster disk space got cheaper and data became more plentiful and I see some modern-day cautionary parallels in some fields that are going that we're looking at right now for instance quantum computing people working on building algorithms for 50 qubit machines when presumably if we ever want to make progress on quantum computing there'll be megabit mega qubit machines and probably a lot of the work we're doing now will be for naught also if you look at the research being done now and actually the application is being done in autonomous vehicle technology presumably in the future all cars will be autonomous there won't be people driving and so so many of the research problems we're solving now in autonomous vehicles are about autonomous vehicles interacting with people drive your human drivers and it seems like a lot of that technology will be will try to be misguided in many ways the way that the last 20 years of AI research some of its business guided and finally the uses of human behavioral data it seems likely based on what's going on in the last few days weeks and months that the world will regulate human behavioral data in some ways which will make a lot of the work we're doing on trying to monetize it illegal if not unethical and immoral so the bottom line is at IBM I learned that you don't spend too much money and effort solving problems that are going to go away when an obviously better technology comes along and don't don't build companies around technologies that are incompatible with the way human beings like to use them so

I learned about the trade-offs between genius and engineering Jim Simon's who is arguably the most influential American mathematician of the 20th century rarely got to use his computational geometry genius at Renaissance what he did use was his common sense understanding that math statistics and optimization Theory actually works many times over the years some of the systems we built stopped working the modeling system started failing portfolio optimization algorithms produced suboptimal portfolios and risk management systems failed and we started losing money and we learned from people who had experience on other Wall Street firms that the problems we were having in the extent to which we were having them many senior managers would have just simply shut us down they would have said what you're doing isn't working we're gonna move on and we'll do something else and typically two years later they would hire back the same kinds of people and rebuild what they thrown away the difference between that and Jim Simons is that he trusted math and he trusted the scientific method and he trusted them enough never to shut us down it'll course helped to have a profit instead of profitable systems that kept making money while we were losing money at times but I digress so one of the main lessons that I learned at Renaissance was the limited value of extreme genius genius is valuable to a point but engineering never stops being valuable and we learned that you shouldn't pay overpay 10 Sigma geniuses guys who are like out-of-this-world brilliance when three sigma geniuses are good enough as an example occasionally we would try hiring some world-class mathematicians that Jim knew that were just pure theoretical mathematicians and we said let's throw some really hard problem at them and see what they can do with it the problem was we had to throw a really good engineer and researcher who could code to help that pure mathematician with their work and that researcher had to be smart enough to understand the math that the mathematician was developing and in the end we had two results first of all well three results first of all the mathematician got really frustrated and ended up wanting to leave secondly we really never got any useful result out of that team and thirdly the really smart and capable researcher that we assigned to do the coding for this mathematician ended up making no progress on research they could have done to produce valuable results that could have helped our system so in the end we find that more than smart enough quants and really good engineers are a recipe for success

I remember one time when one of the most senior managers at the company called all the people under his management to a meeting for a pep talk he said that what made us successful wasn't that we either smart smarter than everyone else other companies had smart people maybe even smarter he said we were a great team we had a great system for doing research and we spent more time and energy on good solid engineering than anyone else so you can predict what happened the researchers of the meeting freaked out because of course all of them thought they were the smartest quants in the world but the manager was right Renaissance was successful because it's geniuses were more than smart enough and its engineers were more than good enough maybe even great and that combination is unbeatable

the final lesson I learned at Renaissance was the tried and true principle keep it simple stupid Occam's razor and never assuming complexity where it isn't called for by evidence was another guiding principle you don't want to use fancy math or fancy AI when simple math or simple algorithms will suffice

as an example when we built our original trading system in 1995 we use human readable ASCII files as a real-time database storage format we actually traded off a system that used a database format of ASCII readable files why because the system crashed every 30 minutes or so and the only way we could figure out why it failed was if it could read the database files and the only way we could restart the the trading system fast enough to keep trading and keep making money was if we could hand edit the files to remove the erroneous entries the funny thing was this design was so useful for so many other reasons we never found a value in switching to a more complex database storage format years and years later we continue to reap the benefits of that simple solution and thank the engineering gods that we never knew never moved away from it

most people using AI don't really know how it works they see a business problem they think AI will help solve it and they pitch a company to do it they figure they'll build the ai ai once they get funding the problem is I learned at IBM and Renaissance is that some problems don't actually benefit from applying a out of them or at least not the latest and greatest AI techniques

at Stanford the old guard used to joke that AI was called AI until it worked then it was just called algorithms and there's lots of computer intelligence encoded in algorithms that aren't called AI anymore but those more mundane approaches sometimes solve business problems just as well as newer ai ai algorithms or better also even if your approach to AI works really well what do you do what it stops working if you don't understand deeply how the flavor of AI you're using works you won't be able to diagnose the problems with it when it fails I also see a lot of companies hanging their hats on off of 10 Sigma geniuses be wary of a company whose product is relying on the cutting edge ideas of a single genius PhD the PhD may be a genius and the idea might be out of this world but if you spend too much money and too much focus on the genius you would better focus enough money and hiring resources on building out the engineering team that is going to implement and support the genius idea and if you're planning on doing your own AI or machine learning in house you'd better make sure you buy good tools to organize your research and development to put guardrails on your research team to make sure their work leads to usable results

a company called P Enzo which is a joint effort of two geniuses out of MIT one of the cofounders is an AI researcher and the other has a PhD focused on human-computer interaction they're both high Sigma genes but there are also practical engineers who understand that each part of what they contribute is critical to the success of their company
