- Annie's dad conversation with us when making Arjun's present, relating to further career plans, when i told about CA group 2 and GMAT, and he ignored the conversation inclining towards Sahil's Banana chips business and adding up his own idea he had when he was off our age, advising Annie in front of me to join his Business instead of job as if job or employment meant a lot less to him.
- Musckaan Chauhan got an internship at IIM Ahmedabad in Economics, while i'm sleeping till 1 in noon, jerking myself off. Anything is possible, no rules-protocol. Cold email, meet people, randomly ask them. Don't assume unless there's significant confidence for Null Hypothesis. I thought that such oppurtunities don't exist, i was wrong, even such educational institutions provide internship oppurtunities other than commercial organisations. You want something go get it, period.
- Aastha and Jiju, brought a guy named Sitanshu before departing to Germany, praising him for his 97%, 99 at Maths, came early morning via 3AM bus and being no.1 at everything, didn't clear IELTS though, but merchant navy interview, body builder, helped break locked door.
- Divyanshu 12th marks vs Me, 12th result and perfomance lessons. College activities of others, Aman Annie Saumya, Sahil, etc.
