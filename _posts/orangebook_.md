4677. "Don?t feel offended because no one cares about you, just become a more valuable person."

4679. Talent arises once you understand true learning and the power of compound interest.

4696. "You don?t know ?what you would do if you were rich? until you get rich. Because the decade-long journey will completely change who you are. It?s easy to misjudge from the sidelines, you need skin in the game to understand."

4722. "@Threeflea1 I've had the exact same thoughts. This pattern is pretty common from what I saw, struggling parents nurturing very smart kids, and vice-versa. Maybe an environment where they are surrounded by people more talented than them, and have to compete and grow to get what they want."
4723. "Funny how it works, in many cases, the luckier and comfier you were whilst growing up, the more entitled and the less grateful you feel. Some of the happiest people I know grew up in the middle of war and famine. Others almost died. There is no gratitude without perspective."

4740. "It?s a shame that as we grow up, most people no longer find the time to get absorbed into a great book for a few consecutive hours."
4741. "@jaapgrolleman My end goal is peace of mind. Anything that creates long-term anxiety or envy, like constantly watching successful people living their lives, is a no go. Key word is ?constantly,? it?s fine to be inspired once in a while. Walks are a great habit imo. Short answer: it depends."

4755. "@mannythoughts12 The educated mind is calm. It understands itself, it is humble because it understands the true complexity of the reality. Many people think education is about credentials and status, but it?s hard to blame them for being misled."
4756. "If you enjoy seeing people fight with each other, you are not happy."
4757. @MaxPetitgenet My definition of an educated mind isn?t the popular one. I can frame it this way: you aren?t educated as you as long you aren?t calm and self-understanding.

6408. "Anyone healthy, confident, fit, happy is attractive. To be healthy, sleep well, eat well. To be confident, make more efforts, grow your talents. To be fit, hit the gym, fast regularly. To be happy, stay mindful, connect with kind, honest, driven people, keep learning."
6409. "I?m wary of the unconfident who never got hit on. What happens when someone much smarter and good-looking than your current partner starts flirting? Loyalty is an asset mostly owned by the self-confident, who are used to optionality, who take responsibility for their choices."
6410. "Two people who can?t handle aloneness can never make a happy couple. Many end up staying together as a habit, not because they are truly thrilled by each other anymore. The best relationships are made out of minds striving for personal growth, not out of convenience."
6411. Growth starts when you realize no one cares about you and your mistakes.

6422. "Money doesn't buy happiness directly, but it certainly helps to be able, to travel and open up your mind, to not worry about food, rent, bills, to go to higher-end social events, to be able to take entrepreneurial risks, to cut off relationships you don't need, to relax."
6423. "Start a company even if you are not the best innovator. Write a book even if you are not the best thinker. Invest money even if you are not the most knowledgeable. Live abroad even if you don't speak the language. No struggle, no growth. Dare to fail."

6432. Your life gets better once you stop paying attention to the lives of others getting better.
6433. "School conditioned us all to believe life was a race. Learning fast to compete in exams. Writing fast to publish prolifically. Talking fast to look smart. Life is not a race. Learn at your own pace. Publish when your work is ready. Talk slowly as long as it's clear."
6434. "@FilioProdigal Thank you ! ???? Twitter is time-consuming enough already. I prefer to focus on one platform and do things well.?? I mostly write for my own pleasure and further constraints would be detrimental. (I have an inactive Instagram account for some people who wanted to tag me.)"
6435. "Years of rejection seem to be a prerequisite to success. Years of efforts seem to be a prerequisite to self-confidence. Years of writing seem to be a prerequisite to clear thinking. Years of solitude seem to be a prerequisite to healthy relationships."
6436. "Many writers are stuck in self-censorship. ""Everything that needs to be written, has already been written, and by better writers than I."" This is false. If your words can benefit even one soul out there, you should do it. Build a writing habit. It will change your life."
6437. @srowlands And it simultaneously creates businesses.
6438. "It's normal to cringe when you read what you wrote a few years ago. It?s normal to cringe when you remember what you did a few years ago. It's normal to cringe when you think about who you were a few years ago. Cringing is healthy. A sign of growth."

6445. "Seventy years ago, in 1950, there were also many rich investors, many good-looking, famous entertainers, models, singers, comedians, athletes, envied by many for their glamorous lives. The common point? They are all dead. You are alive. Stop paying attention to the noise."

8236. "Idealization ends mimetic growth. When lost, find a model. Someone happy, smart, kind, honest, with a lovely family, rich, fit, funny... Anything you want to pretend to. But don?t fool yourself into thinking they?re flawless. Love yourself more than any idea of any guru."

8247. "@BobMadalle That?s a solution, but it takes much more time and it?s pretty wasteful in terms of efforts. The only constraint is often financial ? we can?t stop running, and we are too exhausted during weekends to even think about what we should or shouldn?t do to grow into a better self."

8401. "@NanavatyRahul Agreed! But many people have no idea why their lives ?feel wrong? and are surrounded by others who don?t know either. Uneducated and angry family constantly arguing  gossiping. No defined values. Brainwashed. Lost. For them, the Internet gives access to broader perspectives."
8402. "@trimmer30_98 Fair point. Any tool can either empower or enslave. But at least, it?s leveling out the access to opportunities and knowledge."

8423. "Remember that everything you build enslaves you a certain way.  A company. A career. A reputation. A family. Your own mind. Whether it?s worth being pursued is up to you. Your life, your decisions."
8424. "You can be attractive, fit, rich, with a loving family, full of knowledge  achievements, and still depressed. You can be poor, ignorant, a few limbs missing, and wake up everyday with a smile. It always sounds obvious  repetitive but: it?s about perspective  gratitude."

8428. "You only run out of ideas if the foundations of your mind were clumsily architectured. The existing core, if well-designed from the start, can always expand in new directions. If not, only courage is required to pay no heed to the eyes of others, and do what you need to do."
8429. "Arrogance is sometimes attractive, but rarely to the right people."

8449. @deseanchin02 Reading is always selective.
8450. "It takes efforts from the few to move the lives of the many; but it takes efforts from the many for the few to get the time to make the move. Be grateful if you?re in a position to think and build. Too many ?intellectuals? look down on those stuck in a 9-to-5 job."
8451. The biggest library in the world is useless if disordered. Knowledge is similar.
8452. "A great writer takes time and scribbles, and moves people?s hearts. A great engineer takes time and imagination, and moves people?s lives. The unique mind converts a common resource into a valuable product."

8491. You miss the present when you?re scared of missing it.
8492. "A video of your parents isn?t your parents. The recorded song isn?t the live performance. The picture of the fireworks isn?t the fireworks. If you think you can capture the past, and relive it anytime, you miss the richness of the present."

8510. "@lennywhipshake @snumanali We actually agree. There?s no fight once you?ve figured out a lifestyle where they don?t even arise anymore.

8517. "A lot of people seem to think that there's a magic pill out there that will solve all their worries, a magic book that will make them smarter, or a magic workout program that will make them fit. If magic exists, it's called long-term focused efforts."
8518. "Read the best books several times. The first time, you hear. The second time, you understand. The third time, you learn. The fourth time, you think. After enough reading, the first reading of any book feels like its fourth."

8529. Don?t desire the life that few have if you live the way many do.

8550. All the theoretical knowledge and books in the world are useless if you are unable to act when opportunity arises.
8551. "@Simon_O_Regan As long as you try to copy someone else, you are always at least one step behind. The most successful people don?t try to become the next anybody else. They leveraged their own background, dug further into the unknown, understood the recent trends, and combined them all."
8552. "When it comes to leveraging your knowledge, become a monopoly: someone so unique that no one has a chance to capture the value you create."

8568. "Too much time is wasted on finding a purpose before acting. Your whole narrative is based on nothing. Money, career  ideals only exist in our collective minds. We invent new goals as we go. Not serving any purpose is fine. That?s how nature works. But it makes life more fun."

9403. "It?s not *your* husband/wife/children. Not *your* money. You are neither a job nor a belief: The more you assimilate yourself to a possession, the more likely you are to be disappointed when you inevitably need to part ways. Life itself is temporarily borrowed."

9436. "Don?t focus on how people should behave with you. Focus on whether you behave according to your own principles. Self-improvement starts with conscientiousness, yet the very moment we need to be mindful, emotions  instinctive reactions tend to cloud our good judgment."
9437. "The only sustainable relationships are those based on trust,  and they only happen when both sides possess the common core value of honesty. Manipulative people will drain your energy  destroy your principles."

9441. "A career shouldn?t be a cage: don?t lock yourself up in a false sense of security. Whether you clearly see it or not, there is always a price to pay. Don?t sacrifice freedom  joy for conformity  boredom."
9442. "Modeles of failure are underrated. Take a look at those who never achieved anything  avoid their path. In that category, you have people who only speak up to approve/disapprove everything,  yet never had the courage to take a single initiative nor ever added any value."
9443. "Maybe one day, intermittent fasting and restriction of carbs will be greatly democratized. Everyone will feel lighter, sharper  less depressed. Everyone will be wondering how they could be foolish enough to eat three times a day. I personally wish I had known this sooner."
9444. "Your mind is constantly judging, criticizing  comparing. Yet, as long as thoughts are in the way, you never truly pay attention. Attention is only achieved when focus works in synergy with awareness."

9450. "If you surround yourself with low in energy, moody  overall negative people, don?t be surprised if you can?t find peace in your daily life. Cutting off toxic people is easy once you realize there are plenty of honest, kind  positive people: You just need to make some space."
9451. "Sometimes, you just need to learn to let go of some people. You are not meant to be in their life  they are not meant to be in yours. And it's perfectly fine. No need to feel bad about it.  The world is vast enough for anyone to find adequate companions for their own journey."
9452. @Complexity_Labs Seems like linear thinkers are preponderous in academia.
9453. "Stop asking people what they think about anything. Grow some self-confidence, endure short-term pain, aim for long-term goals, take risks  keep moving forward. Satisfaction comes from being an independent thinker. And the only impartial judge is time."

9459. "Don?t burn the whole forest just because one tree is toxic. Don?t blame an entire group for the misdeeds of the few. Don?t skip the whole book because a few pages are ?boring?. Don?t cower in fear when you fail several times in a row: the chances of success may be independent."
9460. "?Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty.  Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.? ? Franz Kafka"
