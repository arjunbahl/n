Usually google trends say a lot about what people or more precisely society as a whole is thinking about.

After the Demonetisation announcement following trends were followed:

- Gujarat, known for its entrepreneurs, was leading the trend searches- "How to convert black money into white money"
- Maharashtra (Mumbai) and Haryana followed.
- Mumbai being the financial hub of India while Haryana known for its Real Estate sector emerged in the trends.
