- What should we expect from these guys? Jamie is smart. He doesn't have as much cash to work with since he bought Bear. Lloyd's a superstar. Goldman's the smartest shop on the block. And just because I used to be his boss, it doesn't mean he's gonna listen to me. John Mack used to run around the floor screaming, "there's blood in the water! Let's go kill someone!" He's a fighter. Thain was my number two at Goldman. He's selfish. He's a pragmatist. He knows-- if Lehman goes, Merrill's next. Vikram Pandit is the new guy at Citigroup. No one knows if he's running Citi or if Citi's running him.

- If awareness shapes the outer boundary of what is possible in the life of a person, then the ability to operate effec
tively within such a boundary determines the probability that they will. The reason that this relates to agency is that, ultimately, your awareness is what determines your beliefs and establishes the boundaries of what you perceive to be possible. This in turn directly impacts the daily decisions you make about what to do with yourself. If you read any biography of a prominent person, there will almost undoubtedly be a mention of an event or an instance that completely changed how they approached their lives. Sometimes, it’s a brush with mortality, but other times, it’s something as simple as realizing that maybe the rules they had always assumed to be facts weren’t actually set in stone. We all have these pivots of awareness that shift our perspective about what is real and what is important and what is worth doing. We can’t intellectualize them beforehand because they require first-hand exposure through experience. They expand agency by redefining possibility.
