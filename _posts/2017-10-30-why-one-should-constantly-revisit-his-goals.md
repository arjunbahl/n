The more we re-visit our goals the more focus we attain, more aligned we get towards our goals. The more we flash them in front of us, the more committed we become towards them, its like what Muhammad Ali said, "Repetition of affirmations leads to beliefs and once that belief becomes a deep conviction things begin to happen."
