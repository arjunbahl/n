Never refuse or say no directly. It must be indirect. As they say "teda jawab"

For instance, "what fo you think of him?" To which you can refuse by saying, "i think i should be with him rather than you, atleast he wont be asking such useless questions"

Harvey specter always says indirectly, mocking the other guy.
