The most effective tool to get work done is "Tension", possessing it helps to fight off procrastination, just like 2-3 days before examination we tend to get off from all our unproductive activities like mobile phone(Whatsapp, Youtube, etc) or fapping or TV or oversleeping.

Tension helps us to focus, unlike in it's absence, sheer focus is "easily" gained. Otherwise we act like a mouse in a maze trying to escape out of the "uncomfortable" environment, but when tension adapts in, and by it i mean sheer-pure tension i.e no way out of it, no chance for diverting it away it has to be lived by with, no escaping out, only then we are able to channel it towards sheer focus and determination, will power flourishes, perseverance rises, toughness and strength gets tested and with no way out we are "forced" to do what matters. We then have a precise and clear vision of what we ought to do, a single path for a rat to reach out because the only way our mind then sees is "through".

Suddenly alternative options(distractions or non urgent-important activities)Â  diminishes, this minimization of distractions in effect shoots up our focus with which we are able to achieve our goals easily. Therefore try to germinate and incorporate tension into daily life, it puts us into uncomfortable situation but pushes our productivity to new heights, instant of fighting it out learn to "live with it".

Similar advice was given by the person in Ted talk for fighting procrastination whereby he described tension as "a monster in the mind getting rid of he monkey".

Right now i had been studying for over 8 hours and still i feel no incentive to fap, i am highly focused, had there been this level of tension before i would have been way better because i could have achieved all the goals and plans drawn out, more focused over achieving them.In the pass i had hardly studied this long on a single day with such focus and determination as if i'm being forced by my rational as well as unlikely lazy mind to complete the task at hand without being distracted.
