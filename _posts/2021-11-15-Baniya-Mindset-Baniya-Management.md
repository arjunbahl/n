In daily life have Baniya Mindset, not only for financial requirements but for all other aspects as well, for isntance for getting higher productivity and effectiveness. Getting more output from same amount of time. Accomplishing more in limited time, grabbing more oppurtunities in same scenario and time-frame.

For instance if you find 30-40 mins of free time in evening(before heading out to play) use that as well to get output(relevant- as per priorities), maybe for completing course at 2x speed, so that 30 mins gets transformed into an hour.

Or when going to college instead of just "attending" classes get more output by convincing teachers for extra attendance or making good connections with them or peers as well, or any other relevant activity.

Use all the available time in the most effecient manner. Make time available, and then use it in the most optimum manner.

Use Baniya Management, getting more done without sacrificing anything or incurring any cost.
