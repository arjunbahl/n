1. I fucked up in Taxation, Law, Cost because of my preparation.
    1. In Tax, i took Advance Tax, Filing, etc too easily and didn't prepare as hard.
    2. In Law same thing was done by me, i didn't take Business Law seriously, especially Agency Contracts or NI Act, etc.
    3. In Costing my practice wasn't upto mark hence i made blunders in Paper(Under-Over Absorption question, journal entry)
    4. Study with focus and diligence, don't fool yourself.
    5. Prepare for everything, every part.
    6. Sweat while preparing so that you don't have to bleed in battle.
    7. Be serious and aware about your state, had been serious and aware of importance of leftover topics you could have passed with more marks like you did in Accounts.
    8. I scored 82 in accounts highest among all people in college because i practiced so hard over it, did multiple "written" revisions, created concept notes, practiced numerous and almost all varieties of questions available, had a semantic tree for diversity of questions in my mind- that was the level of practice. Was it same with other subjects? No, therefore practice diligently and continuously(I practiced Accounts almost everyday with the 4Subjects in 1 day schedule, however time allotted was almost majorly to accounts as compared to others.)
    9. You have to dive as deeply as possible into your goals. I searched and compiled all available resources for IPCC, joined numerous whatsapp/telegram groups for daily updation-interaction, same goes for all your life goals(Be serious enough so that you leave no stone unturned, i went through all ICAI Supplementary material, official notices, amendment notes, etc.)
2. Don't excuse yourself with "First step towards success is Failure", you should strike your goal at the first shot itself, that's efficiency. If you want to reach the top you need to increase your efficiency and productivity(doing more in less time). For this you need to be "Proactive" like Aman Chitkara(street-smart).
    
    Push yourself and be so confident and committed that you're able to commit to yourself or others that no matter what you'll achieve the goal. For this you gotta be willing to sacrifice and focused on it entirely. You should be so worthy due to your practice, hardwork, diligence, willpower that you knock off the target with one shot at the very first attempt. "You do or do not, there's no try"
3. Focus entirely on your "true goal" adjusted for priorities.
4. Fight till the end, no matter what! Fight to win and not lose small.
5. Don't think of losing, failing, taking it as an excuse for winning "eventually". Win at the straight shot.
6. Be able enough to commit to yourself that you'll achieve no matter what, so that you're confident enough and **losing is not an option.**
7. You think of having an 'option to lose' and think of it as an escape way to further "learn from experience" or "first step towards success is failure" but don't let this philosophy hammer your ability to reach you true potential.
8. You gotta achieve something you should at the very first shot.
9. Learn to take risks and commitment("I will achieve this goal no matter what"). You should be able to challenge people with your commitment towards your goal and not be doubtful about achieving it.
