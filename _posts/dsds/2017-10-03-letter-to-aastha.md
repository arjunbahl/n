To My Sister And The Second Mother It's been 20 years since the first time you had me in your arms, 20 years since the time you've been looking after me, caring for me, standing with me, supporting my outrageous demands. It's been 13 yrs since i've been caring for you, possessive about you, fighting with you for merely TV time, sleeping next to Maa, following you wherever you went- upstairs to your room or downstairs into basement, sometimes consciously and rest unconsciously. And i will continue to do so for the time ahead,i'll be behind you for the time ahead, looking for you.

And now i have one more person to look after, for the next 20 years and beyond i will be looking after my nephew(who shall be named soon :p), i will be following him upstairs and downstairs, i will be possessive for him but as far as Tv or games are concerned we won't be fighting over them.

For the last 20 years you were 'Pillu', now i think tables wil be turned, i hope he has a nice name for me ahead.

I hope i'll be of the same stature to him as you are to me. I hope that we(Me and my nephew) share the same bond, invisible yet omnipresent, as you and i had been and will continue to do so for the time ahead. And i also hope, unlike me, he won't call you for fetching towel everytime he bathes. :P

Yours loving and handsome brother Akki/Akku
