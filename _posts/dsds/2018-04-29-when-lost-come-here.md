“Once a young man asked Socrates the secret to success. Socrates asked the young man to meet him at the riverside the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the water and he did. Suddenly Socrates ducked the kid underwater and held him there till the kid started turning blue. Then, Socrates pulled him out. The first thing the kid did was to take a deep breath. Socrates asked him, ‘Son, when you were under water what did you want the most?’ The young man said, ‘Air.’ Socrates said, ‘Son, there is no secret to success. When you want success, as badly as you wanted air when you were in the water you will have it. Nobody will be able to stop you that day.’ This is called a burning desire. This is the difference between preferences and convictions in life; preferences are negotiable, convictions are not; and under pressure, preferences always become weak whereas convictions become stronger.”

 

” ‘Do you know the difference between winners and losers?’ Then he said something very profound, ‘Winners form the habit of doing things that losers don’t like to do. What are the things losers don’t like to do? Well, they are the same things winners don’t like to do either, but they do them anyway.’ Then he gave me an example. He said, ‘Losers don’t like to work hard. Winners don’t like to work hard either, but they work hard anyway. Losers don’t like to get up in the morning. Winners don’t like to get up in the morning either, but they get up anyway.’”(Chapter:4 Attitude Determines Success)“Discipline is doing what ought to be done, when it ought to be done, whether we like it or not. Life is like push and pull. Sometimes, we push ourselves and sometimes we have to pull ourselves, just like an automobile needs both the accelerator and the brake, one without the other will cause damage. Similarly an army without discipline is guaranteed to fail. Discipline is really the spirit that strengthens an army and gives courage and strength even to a small group to face big challenges.”
