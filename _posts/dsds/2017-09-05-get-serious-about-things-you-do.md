Do you remember how serious you were during the times of skating and TT, you would be so serious and diligent about it that Anil sir would tell others about this quality, rember he told that to your mom and Ranjana aunty one afternoon.

You would practice like its a religion with devotion.

You were just like harvey specter engrossed in completely, but now there's a mix of the character from wake up sid, easy-going and casual.

Change that, get serious about thinga you do.
