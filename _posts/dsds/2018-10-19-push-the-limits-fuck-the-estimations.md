It's not the people who achieve something that is in their favor, in their comfort zone or where odds are in their favour rather those people who have everything against them, out of their comfort zone- limits that are worth pursuing, it's the things/ goals which seem impossible at first, by approximation and estimation, where the chances of success are significantly low, where odds are against them and still they are able able to achieve it. They pull it off.

Think of Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX are not simple viable if one considers normal calculations and estimations, the easy road. But still he pulled it off while all indications were against him. Because thats what matters in the end, pulling off things which lead you to push your limits, whats the fun and point of pulling off things that are well within your reach by estimations.

These guys do whatever it requires, whatever it takes to pull it off and not make up excuses or estimations to justify that. No matter what they pull it off.

All greats have odds against them, and yet they pulled it off as against being discouraged by circumstances prevailing at that time. Thats what makes them one of the greats. Think of Dhirubhai Ambani.

Did you ever think of ever winning national medals at first? No, it would've been ab absurd idea. But you pulled it off, had you believed in the calculations of achieving it you would've been discouraged by it and would've never pursued it. But you did it bi matter what the odds are, you pushed your limits and suddenly it became achievable.

Fuck the estimations - approximations they are just limits put on you, not the potential. Will power is what matters, when you go for a run goal seems impossible at first but will power and doing it eventually pierces way through and you're able to complete the goal set, same goes for those sharing sessions either in the morning or evening that you had. Must of the time they seemed impossible and out of limits but then we achieved them.

Fuck the standards and rules set by people, they are limits as per their minds and perspectives not yours.

It's the crazyones who defy rules, push the limits forward that matter not the ones achieving what's normal and under their lines and comfort zone.
