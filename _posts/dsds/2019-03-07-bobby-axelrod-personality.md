He bluffs, plans real longterm. Uses fuckups, shit happening, obstacles and converts them to huge oppurtunities.

For instance he used his so called "mid life crisis" as a cover up for dumping his long positions in the Telecom sector including the stock involving cooked books fraud.

He used 9/11 a tragedy for him as his friends and partners in the building died to make huge trades instead of getting distracted, used that small window of oppurtunity to make fortune.

He bluffed using Bill Stern to get to ex-employees, or when he bluffed when he got news of a mole in his office.

Uses extreme words like "goddamn", "fucking" as adjectives a lot.

He's always shouting-ranting-intimidating people "silently" in a controlled voice volume and pitch.

Confident, as if he owns the whole goddamn place and people.

They're like snipers-sharks circling around.

"He's got so much in his head."

He analyzes, sees everything.

He's looking for a win. Always. He needs to find at least a small win in every endeavor, every exchange. What happens if he can't find one? Then he'll play a different game, with different rules... Ones you don't know, no one knows, where... he can make your loss bigger than his loss. A lose-lose scenario. And that doesn't bother him? A lose-lose scenario. And that doesn't bother him? Of course it does, but Axe came from nothing. So unconsciously, he fears... No, he may even expect he'll have nothing again. So he... <i>loves</i> to put that same fear into others, especially if they're not familiar with it. Like the Eads family. The naming rights? I heard about that. But that's just the part of him I know... that he's allowed me to see. But you know him better than anybody. Well, I think I do, but I'm not really sure anyone can. He's most likely ahead of you... Especially when it looks like he's not. And if he does go down, he will pull you down with him. I'm not afraid to prosecute anybody. I'm not afraid to prosecute anybody. Okay, it's not about that. It's about you being your alpha self, not letting him pull you out of your game. That's his goal in all his deals... Get under their skin, get them to make a mistake. If this was a different case, uh, at this stage, I would pursue a plea agreement. You would. It's a cardinal rule... You don't trust your career in the hands of a jury of 12 random crazy people who might decide a case based on a wink and a smile who might decide a case based on a wink and a smile and not the law, which they can't fucking understand in the first place. Would he take a deal? He'd settle if he thought it was a win. If he thought he tricked you, even better. The only deal with teeth would have to take him out of business forever. That's the only deal he would never take.

 

Hyperactive, when he found the guy drove his kids while being drunk.

 

Every time you step away from doing something that makes you feel great, even if it makes you feel sad, something inside of you dies. When you feel emotionally messy, take yourself someplace where the boundaries are clean. - Dr. Gus (Billions)

 

So you should feel great. You saved your kingdom and rewarded richly the knight who fell on his sword so you could do it. A king who does not mourn that knight and that goes on building his own castle. Oh, so that's why you missed on the trade. You loved him, so subconsciously, you're punishing yourself. I stole from him. His time, His time, Without his permission. Doctor presented me with a chance to get Donnie some experimental treatment, not a cure. But it could've extended his life a... few months... and maybe long enough for him to have seen Christmas. But also maybe long enough for him to testify against me. And... And... I stopped that from happening because it didn't suit my purposes. And I'm punishing myself because I cannot believe I have the capacity to do that to someone I care about. That's your fear? That even when you care about someone, you can use them for your own ends. If that is true, I don't like what it says about me. It may be true, but that's not what this is. You're punishing yourself because you're understanding You're punishing yourself because you're understanding that you didn't care about Donnie. Not really. That's what scares you. Yes. When I heard about Donnie's death, I... I felt relief. And all the rest... The sorrow, the sadness... It was... it was buried way down. It was... it was buried way down. Like it didn't exist at all. That's right. So the question you've been afraid to ask out loud, but have been whispering to yourself ever since, do you wanna ask it? - Do I have to? - I think you do. I can't say it for you. Well, people who have the capacity to feel nothing... Well, people who have the capacity to feel nothing... they call them sociopaths. Is that what I am? What do you think? I don't know. If you didn't have it, you wouldn't have lost the money, you wouldn't be punishing yourself. But it is a... crucial time. But it is a... crucial time. Your switch plate is removed, your wiring is exposed. Your blue ones go where your red ones should, that's for sure. A normal person wouldn't engage in the behavior. A sociopath wouldn't give a shit. You're somewhere in between. You are practiced at turning off your feelings. Do it enough, it's a pattern. Keep going, they die. So it's either fix it... or close yourself back up and see what happens.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I got news last night I never wanted to get... Chuck Rhoades, coming at me. I have lived my life as an exemplar of rectitude so as to never have to deal with this kind of thing. Still... he comes. You did what I'm about to. You squared off with him, walked away unmarked. I need your playbook, I need to know how to beat him. Will you help me? I don't remember your reassuring hand on my shoulder when it was my time of trouble. What I do remember is you, the exemplar of Wall Street rectitude, steering clear and making damn certain that my stink didn't waft anywhere near you, lest it stick. Now, before I decide, answer this. Are you a bastard? Because for you to have a chance against Rhoades, you need to be. Even though there will be lawyers, there are no fucking rules... not if you want to win. You will have to crawl through a river of shit and risk bleeding out a hundred yards short of victory. You have to be prepared to do things that are entirely outside the bounds of conventional morality. What do you imagine I had to do to get to the top of Spartan-Ives?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, Dr. Gus told me a bit about your conversation. Therapy is supposed to be confidential. It's not therapy. He seems to think that you don't get something out of winning. He wanted me to pull you from this entire event. You didn't listen. Eh, he may not be very good at his job. You love winning. I do? Yeah. I keep going back to why you quit the live game in college. I didn't like... I think it's that you didn't like that it put the two things that really fucking matter to you... winning and being thought of as good... in direct conflict. Heads up for the Alpha Cup in two minutes. I didn't quit. They kicked me out, and it hurt. I couldn't compete, so they eliminated me, and it filled me with disdain, almost hate. Hate is nature's most perfect energy source. It's endlessly renewable. I don't want to lean into that feeling. You know the rider in the bicycle movie who, just when he has victory in sight, takes his hands off the bars and just holds them out like this, taking in the sun, gliding, letting all the other racers whiz by him just because? No, I don't. What fucking movie is that? I always want to be that biker. Yeah, but you're not. You and I don't get to glide. We churn, and we don't get to become friends with people we play cards with, but that's the sacrifice we make for being able to see what we see. I know you believe that, but I choose to take a different lesson. It's not a choice. Now go back down to that table. And if, when you see Krakow, you think that maybe he will become a friend, then go ahead. Take your hands off the bars and let him ride on by.

 

 

 

 

I think you're on a gut shot, four-five or five-six. I think you're trying to bully me, and a bully's devastated when you stand up to him.

 

 

 

 

 

 

No. Your anger is what stands between you and winning, your inability to De-personalize this competition, and as a result... My inability? I didn't pay you to come here and criticize me.

 

 

 

 

I'm Ira Schirmer, attorney for Charles Rhoades Jr. I'll be asking you a few questions. Orrin Bach for Robert Axelrod. Are you ready? Rock and roll. Let's go on the record. You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you... I'm sorry. Can we go off the record? I just wanted to say, you did a great job rebuilding. Sometimes I laugh myself to sleep at night just thinking about you ripping the place apart. - Hey, Chuck. - Oh. You know, I never think about it. But then, of course, I'm not alone at night. Let's go back on the record. You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you. Off the record. Where are you sleeping now? Bobby. Suitable accommodations. Mm-hmm. Who paid for it... me or Daddy? We all know Uncle Sam pays you shit. It was me. Found some loose change in the cushions. Is this going to happen or... Back on the record. You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you. How do you know he didn't have a legitimate reason to be in your office? Well, it was the middle of the night. He didn't come with a SWAT team, not even a subpoena. It was just him, trying to intimidate me. But his wife works for you. He could have been coming to see her. His wife had quit working for me. So, are you saying you did or didn't intercede with the police and bribe them regarding your employee, Mick Danzig? - I... - Objection. This is a deposition. Objections are waived. Except to form. That was a compound question. I can answer. A smart man listens to his lawyer. I'll rephrase. Did you bribe the police regarding Mick Danzig? Look, this whole thing is about what <i>he</i> did. That question isn't. So you're declining to answer? Yes. An element of your claim is damages. Are you willing to open up your books to show the concrete monetary damages you've supposedly incurred? Yes, I have damages. No, I am not willing to show my books at this time. Ah, so then you must not be asserting actual damages? You're saying that your damages can be presumed from Mr. Rhoades' actions? Right. Right. Legally, we call these mental or emotional damages. So... are you saying Chuck hurt you mentally, or are you saying he hurt you emotionally? I'd like to take a break. Oh, you don't want to announce to the whole Street that Chuck hurt your feelings? He got into your head, threw you off your game? Turn the camera off. We're taking a break. What? Sanford Bensinger is on the phone. Sandy. We call it the Giving Oath because you fucking swear it. Do you understand what an oath is? I do. I do, and I've already begun moving on what we discussed, and actually, I was gonna reach out to you to talk about structuring a trust. You mean a photo op? <i>Maybe in costume.</i> <i>Me as John the Baptist,</i> you as the Son of Man. Hey, look, Sandy, I'm as... I'm as upset as you are that our meeting got tipped off to... <i>Do me the courtesy of not lying again on this phone call.</i> I do not appreciate being used. I got to be where I am by connecting the dots, scores of randomly placed ones. The NFL is turning you down. I asked for the favor of telling you myself. They're, um... They're really gonna walk away from the highest bid? Sports franchises are how we knight people in this country. And you're not royalty. You're a robber baron. We're talking about damages. I have actual, concrete, monetary ones. You cost me a professional football team. Can we go back on the record? Actually, I think we need a break now. No. Let's continue. A wise man always listens to his lawyer. I keep my own counsel. Let's keep going. Fucking right, we will.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, I-I just want to know if you've heard from Wags. No. I had heard he's M.I.A. and that the guys here miss him, which surprised me. What, that he's off the grid or that they miss him? Anyone could see that he was driving towards a wall like Dale Earnhardt at Daytona. And what did you do to stop it? No. No, sir. If a crash is coming, I say you bring it. It's the only way to get to the other side. If you survive. Look, you hired me to help you maximize results, not to coddle the staff. He hired you. I sort of rubber-stamped it. And you listen to all of his suggestions? You said you were surprised that they missed him? Well, they talk about him like they hate his fucking guts most of the time. That way they don't hate me. He's willing to put himself in that spot. So it's his loyalty that matters to you. This isn't about me. You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo. You could've just called. You came in here because you want it to be about you. Because you need it to be about you. And I am here for exactly that purpose. Really? Let me into that kitchen. What specific role does Wags serve for you? He's my personal bullshit detector. And he makes me laugh. Well, I can fill that role. You'll be my bullshit detector? Absolutely. Like a double shot of Skin Bracer across the chops. Well, let me do the same for you. One... the only way you are ever getting in my kitchen is if my chef takes the weekend off. Two... I'd never trust anyone who'd undercut the man who got him a job. Three... when the guys look in here and see you training for the Tour de France in your underwear in Wendy Rhoades' office, they're not inspired. They're just wondering why the hell she isn't here anymore.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Larry... in a few moments, the FBI are gonna come walking through that door and they're going to arrest you. You can't run. There's no time. Rhoades fucked me like you thought he would. And you got the call before you went on, didn't you? Your whole manner changed. You didn't even warn me. I couldn't. Because you needed me to go on the air to corroborate your story, get your message out, save your quarter. I get it. It was smart. This is some fucked-up universe we've decided to live in. How can I help now? Hold this for me. And I need you to get word to my lawyer. And Linda? Make sure she tells the kids before they find out from the news. Done. Larry. I know.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

<i>Birch!</i> Naira's fucked, huh? But I don't hear panic in your voice. Come on. All the panic got shook out of me about a year ago when Chuck Rhoades came calling. Yeah, I imagine it did. <i>You know, for the longest time, I couldn't synthesize it.</i> How that story came out in the paper, <i>how there was just enough in that article</i> <i>to bait the U.S. Attorney's Office.</i> Yeah, it was a bad beat, no doubt. Well, since then, I've had a lot of time to just sit and think, <i>and slowly, it dawned...</i> <i>If I lost, someone else must've gained.</i> <i>So I ran a thousand simulations a day in my head.</i> And over and over again, Bobby, it came back the same. <i>I was your stalking horse.</i> You did the transaction. You left the opening. It's funny. I was just about to say the same thing to you. You left <i>me</i> the opening. <i>You cost me my business.</i> <i>Now you're gonna throw me some deal as an apology?</i> <i>No.</i> I'm not that easy. So instead of betting against the Naira, I went the other way. <i>And I let a few other folks know what was going down.</i> Strong move. Might have done the same in your spot. I know you would've, Bobby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or you can tell me what the fuck is going on. How? Isn't the point of analysis that we don't know? Which is why I'm not in that racket. We don't have that kind of fucking time. Not anymore. Fucking right we don't. I got a goddamned I.V. stand living in my hotel room. Good. Now, whatever caused this didn't make you retreat. You didn't become depressive. You chose distraction. I'm sad, lonely. Give me an immediate answer. I mean, it doesn't have to be right, just... just blurt it. When did this feeling first land? I was in the bathroom. <i>I was in this club on the Lower East Side.</i> <i>I just overpaid</i> <i>for what were supposed to be actual quaaludes.</i> <i>What were you doing on the Lower East Side?</i> <i>Drinking with this prick I worked with years ago.</i> <i>God, I hated that prick.</i> <i>I hated him when we worked together.</i> <i>I hated him even more that night.</i> <i>Why did you agree to drink with a guy you hate?</i> I drink with pricks I hate all the time. It's the job. It's the ones who aren't that stand out like giants. Holy shit. Holy shit. Phil. I can't believe I missed this. Phil? Phillip Carroll. Another prick? No. No, the opposite. Guy was my mentor. Back when I started at Lehman. He was the Wilt fucking Chamberlain of Wall Street. Paid for the whole group's vacations when he killed it. Didn't even close his door when he got crushed. <i>I saw him on the street.</i> Hey, Phil! <i>He looked at me, and I waved.</i> <i>He walked right past me.</i> <i>Fucking DK'd me like I was a ghost.</i> <i>Turns out, he has early-onset Alzheimer's.</i> <i>Can't even go out by himself now.</i> <i>His wife left him. His kids don't come around.</i> <i>It was... fucked.</i> <i>He was there, but he wasn't there...</i> a carcass with no further purpose. What you saw would have brought up issues of mortality and diminished utility for anyone. You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low. That's empathy. Why did his plight cut you so deep? What made you so vulnerable to this idea of fading away? Axe hired a fucking Chief of Staff. Her name is Steph Reed. Oh. So now he doesn't need you anymore. And if he doesn't need you anymore, no one does. You have outlived your utility. There is nothing left for you to do but die. But you're not dead. Which means it is time to pivot. To evolve into what it is you'll become next. Wendy reassembled me, piece by piece, on that bench. That's what she does. And I decided I had to give you the chance to make the change here you need to. To modernize. Optimize. To put this old horse out to pasture. Yeah, well, I'm sorry about Phil, but this place doesn't fucking run without you. I do need you. Especially since I just let Steph Reed go. You did? You were wrong. I'm not human. I am a machine. I'm a fucking Terminator. So, your resignation is rejected.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I saw Bruno down there. He was here about the muni bond? Lobbying for Sandicot. What do you think I should do? You finally asking me for my opinion? I wasn't cutting you out. I'm just trying to wrap my head around all this. But now I really need to know what you think. I can see how painful this is for you. It was all over your face when you were talking to Bruno. It's tough. I just sank a shit ton of money into a place that will never be able to repay its obligations. But if we go soft, like Bruno wants us to, we'll lose the better part of 500 million dollars. Whereas if we do what it takes to make the bond viable, we're gonna clear over $100 million. I can see both sides of this. Those people up there are who we used to be. That's what Bruno said. Did anyone ever help us, or look out for us? When my mother was closing the blinds so that bill collectors wouldn't know that anyone was home? No. The way we were brought up, it was always them or us. And it still is. That's what I think. And like you said, Bobby... in the end, everyone else is cannon fodder. So I say you go up there, and you do what you got to do. Cut off the gangrenous parts. And then we go in with charter schools and outrage, for about $30 million. We capture the tax write-off, and those kids will be better off than their parents, or we, ever were. Before we go out, can you order pizza for the kids? Chinese tonight. The one they like doesn't deliver. And George isn't here yet. I'll get it. Seize all their assets... property, utilities, machinery, vehicles, buildings. Everything, even Town fucking Hall. Look to seize the town's bank accounts, payroll accounts, pension funds. Do it. They'll fucking agree to it because they've got no choice. And don't stop till we get what we're owed.

 

 

 

 

 

\- Taylor, right? - Right. How can I help you? I have to tell you, I've had 927 hours of therapy. So you've seen cognitive, humanistic, probably some holistic. What do you think you need? I need to know... Mafee. He's struggling. He's our executing trader. He needs to be "on." He's not. And his fall-off coincided with my advancement, which makes me... I was his intern. He could have taken credit for my work. He didn't. So now you're feeling guilty. And you're wondering if that's healthy? More than that. I want to know if it's useful. Do you care about your relationships at Axe Cap? How are those relationships? Good. - Why do you think that is? - I know why. Because the culture is set from the top. Since Axe likes me, other people do, or pretend to. Why do you think he likes you? One of the two reasons anyone likes anyone else. Either they recognize a part of themselves, or they see something they can use. In this case, I imagine it's both. There's another reason people like each other. They see something they're lacking, and they want to be near it. Is that what's between the two of you? I've noticed a... connection. Everyone always just assumes we were fucking. I didn't. No. We met at a similar moment, when we were both trying to figure out who we were going to be. - And did you? - What? Turn out the way you figured back then? In some ways, we did. And in other important ways, we maybe fell a little short. You're at a similar moment with a similar unlimited possibility. - Okay. - In all my years here, no one has walked through that door because they were worried how another person was feeling. If you were anyone else, I'd think you were pranking me. I am different. Uh, yeah. As far as Mafee goes, maybe just tell him you think he's doing a good job. He's not. And I don't like to lie. To myself, to others. I've been there, and I'm past that. Well, then encourage him without words. Let him know you care. How? Just buy him something.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wags, what are you doing here? Spartan-Ives is reducing their fee 20 percent - for the next two years. - Outstanding. I guess loyalty gets rewarded. Mafee helped. Say the other thing, the thing that made you come out here instead of just texting. 20 percent is good. It's great. But it's not drive-over- in-the-middle-of-the-night great. It... I'm not supposed to be the one all fucking worried about grinding out the extra 20. Uh, yeah, you are. It's your job. On paper. But when I'm actually doing it, it means you're not because you're worried about something else. Yeah. Foley. There is no reason to spend this much energy, time, and money trying to parse the secret motives of some son of St. Tammany. You're right. There isn't. Except for one. Aluminum. That's what it tastes like, anyway. Fear in the back of my throat. You know, most people, they try to move away from fear, try to organize it out of their lives as soon as they're able. Me? I cultivate it. I try to recognize it and order it and use it. That's how I survived growing up, and it's how I still live my life today, heeding and listening to my fear. And what's it telling you now? That this is not just some political move. It's personal. And I cannot rest until I fucking know why.

 

 

 

 

 

 

I got you a birthday present. - Him? - No. Klaxon. - Belgian car company. - An auto scheme? I'd rather have the ballplayer. At least this guy can hit. This is better. It's something I couldn't discuss at the office. Did you know about this? Not the details, only that there was something worth hearing. I heard rumors. Dug into it off-campus, off the books. They're headed for a recall. Major fines, sanctions. - Bottom's gonna drop out. - When? Unknown, but we gotta move fast to lay in our position. This news won't hold long. What's your level of certainty? I am not uncertain. Any particulars I need to know? No. I'll think about it. Whoa, wait. This... this is automatic. This cow's got a bolt to its head, and it's hanging upside-down. You just gotta carve it up and eat it. Times are changing. No matter how not uncertain you are, these days, I take a laparoscope to the fucking guts of every deal. Gents, if I may... What's to gain? A hundred million? It's a drop in the bucket. It's not worth giving the government the opening. Perfectly said, Wags. Has he made you afraid of Rhoades, whispering pussy excuses in your ear? You're really that fucking scared, Axe? You back off, Bill. Why? 'Cause he can end my world, burn my contacts, and keep every cent of my bonus for himself? That... That's supposed to make me hold my tongue? - Fuck, yeah. - See? That... That's why you will never buy and sell equities. No, all that's supposed to make me more brazen when I know I'm fucking right. It's okay, Wags. It's okay. Come Here. If I were standing where you are, I'd be even more strident in my approach. But I'm standing here, so I have to be the opposite... reflective, calm, considered. It's just about who I am at this precise moment in time. What business are we in, hmm? I thought it was a business of profit, of free men and women, beyond the apparatchiks and their pathetic rules. Yeah, all of that and "Who is John Galt?" Look, I'm a rich man. You're a very rich man. If we can't live how we want, then the terrorists have already won. Back in the cage! - Let's go. - What the fuck was that? That was a guy who was giving me all the right questions.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tell me about Axe. He was unreadable. At three o'clock, he was writing checks to aid earthquake victims in the Caribbean. At 3:45, he was cornering the market on Churchill first editions just to stick it to an enemy. And then one day, he just fragged my ass. I never really saw it coming. Did he give an explanation? No. I guess he just didn't want a witness anymore. Referred to himself as a Terminator.

 

 

 

 

 

\- You know what I hate? - Fish, fowl, or mammal? Learning something about myself. When is that bullshit just gonna stop? - Dollar Bill? - What he said, he's kind of right. I've become a pussy. No. We just made a choice to stop living on the edge is all.

 

 

 

 

 

I grew up playing stickball. You wanna grab that broom handle and stand in? I'll get too intense. Okay. People are telling me I can't miss your party. No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores. They have no fucking idea why we do what we do. I don't think I'm any better than them. Of course you do. You even know it a little bit. Do not feel obligated to attend. - Okay. Why are you missing it, by the way? You don't wanna party with me? It's my sister's wedding. Rehearsal dinner on Mackinac Island in the U.P. - Michigan. - Oh, yeah. I know. Not a lot of flights. You're rich. They're called private planes. - I almost booked it. I just don't know if I can actually get on it. The carbon footprint alone is... You're really that worried about the world ending? Yes. What about your own world? Not so much. Well, before that existential dread racks you, buy some offsets. Donate to the Rainforest Alliance. As a matter of fact, if you do that, I'll have Deb book the plane for ya. Done. Move on. It's not just that. It's... I never thought I'd be thinking about living this life. You're living it already. Do you think I ever thought I'd be here? I never thought I'd be more than just a numbers guy at the track. Aqueduct? Nah. Trotters. I'd still be at the track if it weren't for this one guy, a gambler. He worked a seat at Commodities. He thought I'd be good. So he took me to Four World Trade, and I saw it immediately. I could read the tape just like the odds on the board. It was like walking into something between a casino and the U.S. Mint. So I bought a seat at the exchange for 64K, and that was it. Is that a common career trajectory? Not anymore. Wasn't back then either. And you're glad it went this way? Yeah. Why shouldn't I be? So before I let you get back to your childhood, the moral of the story is... just get on the fucking plane, huh? No. The moral of the story is, you get one life, so do it all.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A man as steely as a Roman centurion, cooler than Jean-Paul Belmondo. He's a jaguar shark, an American Sniper, every decision in the space of seven breaths. If you cross him, he'll put a fucking ding in your universe. But these are all exaggerations, derivative. They don't limn the truth of an indefinable essence. They don't speak to my real feelings. It's no exaggeration to say that Bobby Axelrod is the man who gave me my life, or at least let me keep it. But even more than that, he's given me friendship... the kind of friendship, it's more than money, it's more than talent, it's... almost family. But unlike family, he never turns away. He's the only one who truly sees me and doesn't judge. He accepts me as I am, and that kind of friendship is... everything. It is the stuff of life itself. So thank you... for my life. Traders trade. Lovers love. Cars are meant to go. Happy birthday, Axe, wherever you are. Way to go, Wags! Axe didn't show up? Who does that, skips his own party? That's fucking fantastic. Maybe he's an introvert, too. No, he's not an introvert. He just remembered he's an outlaw. A fucking desperado.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Did you find her? Yes. She went into the city with the boys, but I don't... know how to bring them home. I'm sorry. What do you want? What I've always wanted, to help. I was remembering... when you first met her. Me, too. And you said you felt like you'd known her forever. Everyone else was sucking up, angling. One date and you were talking about marriage. I was skeptical. I thought that sort of thing only happened in the Sicilian hills. And then I met her. Then it all made sense. You know, she had three close friends who lost their husbands on 9/11. Firemen. And she helped to prop them all up, even after losing her own brother. She helped them clean out their closets, and you wouldn't think that that was the toughest thing, but the way they wept when they found a favorite t-shirt or an old varsity jacket or a wedding suit. And then about a week later, something occurred to her, and for all three of them, she found a way to get back into their bedrooms. And she crawled under the beds and retrieved the errant slipper or sneaker. She defended them from those little land mines. You don't talk about that side of her much. Look, I, um... I know that you feel bad. But that doesn't fix anything 'cause I tried. I'm limited to waiting now, and you know the problem with that? You fucking hate waiting. <i>Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message.</i> Hey, it's me again. You know what? Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Wendy Rhoades isn't helping. Maybe I should just blow her the fuck out of our lives. Whatever it takes to get you home, get us talking again, just say the word, and I'll erase Wendy Rhoades from our world forever.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hi, it's Lara. Leave a message. You're punishing me. I get it. I get it. I have never punished you. Not once. Not once. I'm making one mistake, and fine, fine. It's not a contest. You think I can't control this, or you? That you're teaching me some, some fucking lesson? I teach the fucking lessons, and you are about to get one. Lar, I will lock you the fuck down and operate you by fucking remote control with a flick of my motherfucking fingers, Lar! You don't believe me? Try me, goddamn it. You want to, you want to take this vacation, this, this adventure? Have it, go for it! Get it out. Then come the fuck home!

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- Taylor, I know you come from analytics, and I know that the numbers are where you live, but got to learn the other piece, too. There's a small group who can do the math. There's an even smaller group who can explain it. But those few who can do both... they become billionaires.

 

 

You run your department as you see fit. - But... - Yeah. You got to look right into their eyes as the life drains out of them.

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR ASSESSING ANALYSTS I have broken down and ranked each analyst in the following ten categories, performance, process, 360-degree workflow, quality of models, culture fit, team mentality, sheer number of fresh ideas, stubbornness, in both its good and bad shadings, value/skew tendencies, that is, do you look for low-risk, large-skew opportunities, and bias. Do you get anchored to old names that aren't working? And then I created an 11th category, which I am calling desire. That is where we will start our discussion this morning. So, if you would, please talk about your desire to remain at Axe Capital. I grew up in Idaho. We had a business club in the ninth grade, mock investment accounts. By tenth grade, I was running money in an e-trade account for the principal of my high school, the guidance counselor, and the asshole gym teacher. Gym teacher? I kept his in a separate account, made sure it nose-dived the day after graduation 'cause... fuck that guy. So, your anger at a person in a higher station led you to take punitive action and book a loss. You gonna fire me for being honest? What gives you a distinct advantage over all the other capable people here? Brain power... sheer mental capacity. You are that far beyond the rest of us? Well, not you. I don't mean you. So, you're both wildly egotistical and scared of conflict. No. I'm... I asked my father, and he said to project that I'm not at all worried about this. Interesting approach, Pununzio.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm over here! Cool bachelor pad... bro. I wasn't gonna stay in Westport. Guys like you head to the city when their marriages fall apart for the same reason birds fly south instead of freezing their asses off. It's in the genetic code. You're the first person to see the place. Other than the kids. What do they think? It's stocked with video games and snacks. They seem fine. How about you? Did you just change out of the pajamas three minutes ago? Are you planning to come to the office anytime soon? Yeah, once my assets are unfrozen. Should everyone else go home, too? Not if they want to stay on the payroll. That's inspiring stuff. Must be what Kennedy said to his staff during the Cuban missile crisis. Kennedy wasn't under as much pressure as I am. I tell you, Bobby, it's times like these I... I wish you hadn't fired Dr. Gus. - Why? - Because this... is a fuckin' disaster. I get it! I get it. You're worried that every day you're on the sidelines makes it harder for you to make your numbers for the year. Not harder. Impossible. - Right? - Well, know this. You won't fall below the hard deck. No one is crashing and burning. If you come through for me now, you will all make a bonus of at least what you made last year. But first, you need to deliver on today's mission. The idea dinner. Top-ten hedge-fund managers in the city will be there. These rat fucks are how these billionaires measure themselves. Even being in the room confers upon you almost mythical status, like you're a knight of the Round Table. - They ride in on horses? - Maybachs. I've heard Axe say he'd never go to one of these hog shows. Yeah, that he couldn't understand why anybody would want to sit with his rivals and give away good plays. The whys and goddamned wherefores are not for you to concern your pretty little heads with. I think it's great that we're invited, considering. We're kind of the most toxic shop on the street right now. They begged him to come, sent emissaries, gifts, all to ensure he'd be there to share his insights. I'm so radioactive right now, I had to beg an invite to this idea dinner. I need to understand why you'd do that. Why do you think it matters? Look at where I am. Indicted, thanks to your husband. Thanks to you giving in to the worst of your instincts. Well, yeah, maybe that, too. But the point is I'm about to stand trial. If I win, I want a company to return to. The government, by freezing my funds, is trying to tell the story that we're crooked. They know we're not. They know they spent years trying and failing to prove it, but the story is being written every day now. So events like this idea dinner, they also tell a story. So if I'm there, I'm telling the story that I'm not cowering, I'm not hiding, I'm not defeated. But I can't just show up. I have to dominate it. The only thing is, for the first time in my life, I don't think I can. Fear? Rage. We need to arm him with an idea that will shock and awe so the dinner ends with Axe's idea e-mailed and texted from firm to firm, leaving no doubt we are still the sharpest. So go generate some speedballs he can dazzle with or go the fuck home for good. You're not authorized to guarantee bonuses. Your ego just wrote a check your body can't cash. I appreciate you waiting until after the meeting to hit me with that one. I know holding back doesn't come naturally. Well, I was so shocked you could quote "Top Gun," it took me a second to respond. I figure speaking their language is part of the job now. But none of this is going to matter unless Axe gets us back in the game. I have our best man working on it right now. I want to run a Dickens process. Tony Robbins took me through it a few years back, so... Sit down. I take you to specific moments in your life, use them to jump into the future. You get to experience different possible versions of your life, like in... Like "A Christmas Carol," hence, Dickens. Let's find a moment early on when your rage served you. Close your eyes. Let it come to you. Fifth grade. I needed money. There were these rich eighth-grade pricks from Harrison. God, I hated their stupid faces. I had an Islander jersey and a Koho hockey stick. I signed 'em Mike Bossy and Bryan Trottier, and the dickbags bought 'em. What'd you get? $300 cash, new sneakers, Atari. When they found out, they went to town on me like Dave "The Hammer" Schultz. God, I got so angry at them, my parents for not having enough money, myself for getting caught. That rage... grew in me. It worked like jet fuel for years. It was useful. Yeah. Fuck, yeah, it was. Got me here. Your brain, instincts, market feel, all that, had more to do with it. But for the moment, let's agree that the rage worked for a time. But let's look for a moment when it was the wrong tool and it cost you more than it made you. We're gonna talk about your husband now? No, about you and how when you allow your anger to make you blind to consequences, it shuts off those other more crucial skills. Let's take a moment from your personal life with Lara. She'd say I allowed my anger to throw everything away, to crack the foundation of trust. So what if you could go back into your past? How would you handle that memorabilia sale? My past? Nah, I wouldn't change it. Good. We can't. But holding on to the feeling of that rage, look to the future. Where do you see yourself in five years if you carry on this way, if you continue to carry the weight of this anger? Where are you in 10? 20? Are you happy? Are you fulfilled? Or are you lonely, bitter? Lashing out. Fuck Dickens! All I see is jail and the company I spent my lifetime building up reduced to rubble. Look, I want to do this with you. I want to believe that it can help. But I just don't think I can. Okay. But now you know exactly where your focus needs to be, where you need to be. At the office.

 

 

 

 

As is often the case, the longer you can hold off, the more likely you'll be screaming in pleasure at the end. We're not making a porno, Orrin, though I appreciate the effort to make me laugh. My father always said laughter was the best medicine, which is why I was so confused when I finally tried cocaine in the '80s. Okay. You lightened my mood. Now make me really happy and tell me how we expose all the shit that Rhoades pulled to suck me in. Easier said, Bobby, because we can't introduce that without confirming your actions as a response. We'd be virtually admitting your role. What he did, it's a fucking crime. Maybe. But it's not a defense. All right, get to the rest. Let's get our new head of compliance up here. The answer man is here. The charges carry a long potential sentence. 15 to 20 years and tens of millions in fines, of course. They're using the locked-up money to distract us as they meticulously build their case. They are using the locked money to do three things. One, to make me take a plea. Two, to make it hard for my people so they'll quit. And, three, to spread the word through implication that this is about more than my actions against Ice Juice, that we are an illegal enterprise. Turn on the telestrator, because you just diagrammed the shit out of this. How long can they really keep it frozen? Wrong question. This is where the holding out comes in. Don't let anyone know you care. Mm, we'll find a way to get you liquid again in four to six months. Months? Fuck that. There is one idea that might get it done right away, but it's one you're going to hate. Give up your so-called license to trade. Walk away from the table. Cash in your chips. They'd be forced to release the bulk of your money. That is the only angle that I see. And if it's the only angle that I see, it's the only angle there is. You agree to stop trading, you personally, and they give you back your money. We would set something up where Axe Cap trades it without your direction. It would function like a blind trust, but the language would be such and they'd be releasing so much money back to you that if you violated it... Oh, that is a bozo no-no. Do that and you would earn yourself a lifetime ban... and more. No. No fuckin' way. I'll never do that. If I give up my ability to trade, I'm agreeing that they're right and I built all this by cheating. I might as well give up my license to breathe. You guys have to work it out yourselves. Do not put me in the middle of it. What the fuck is... What's the problem? Your lap dog is not cooperating. Wags, although Lara should have faith, because I've shown I'm pretty good at making a dollar, she has a right to choose and make her own decisions, like I told you. I thought you were telling me with a wink. That's why I played back with the "liege" stuff. - Did I wink at you, ever? - Not an actual wink, but... Are you planning on giving him your money to manage? If it ever gets unfrozen, I might. - Why? - For general health, financial, and for things between us. Now that I'm able to take outside money, I thought I'd start with friends and family. We're neither. Listen, Lara, I won't micromanage you. But if you really plan on giving billions of dollars to this stock jockey, ask him this, how he's codified the behavioral heuristics at his firm from stock selection to position sizing to market timing to risk management. He hasn't, because his decision-flow process is Google, Exxon, Proctor & Gamble, same as any old lady in Kansas City, except she won't charge you two and twenty for it. We are all in the same game, Axe, protecting assets and trying to find that edge. You have about as much edge as Mister Rogers. Okay, guys! Okay, you go on ahead, sweetheart. You look into everything you want with Birch, and I will support whatever you decide. Thank you, Bobby. You really want me to let 'em into the books and see the trades? Lots of guys watch Bruce Lee movies. Doesn't mean you can do karate. Boot up the screen.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is all on background, no attribution. Yep, until you want to go on record. Good. You know, if they were gonna charge the firm, they would have. Well, isn't their argument that this one instance could be the tip of the iceberg, that they need to go through all the old trades to see if there's a pattern? But that could take months. It's harassment, Randy. They've already spent years going through all those old trades, trying to make a case, and they've failed. Now they've come up with this story about me and sabotage, which you will see is false. Look, I shorted that company 'cause I saw a faulty process and bad financials, and I'm being penalized because the markets agreed with me. I was set up. Now, soon you'll have all these details, but what they are doing right now is they're trying to ruin not only my reputation but that of everyone who works at Axe Capital, and that is the story you should be digging into. Hi. Want dinner? Do we need to do that?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You coming in, nagusi? Nope. Case. All day. Something hot for Axe. An iron condor with four... - Please. Go back to B school. - Anything good yet? How about a strangle where we arb the vega on... You go back to fucking yourself. I just need two minutes with Taylor. Everyone does. You have to wait. - Hey, Wags, listen... - Don't want to fucking hear it. Nope. As soon as. Yeah, well, be all over Taylor till they figure it out. - If I flame this dinner... - No chance, sahabi. Never let it happen. Orrin, time for you to go see your protégé. You want me to propose the deal? I want you to remind him what happens to guys like him when they take this big a swing and miss. I want you to remind him that the political winds have shifted. It's better if I show up with something to offer. Then bring him a glass of fuckin' milk, but go do it. Field trip. Come on. Where? Somewhere we can talk without everyone coming at us. I know a place. Ever seen Eastern Promises? No. Have you ever been to one of these idea dinners? No seconds in attendance. Ugh. Where are we on an idea? Haven't fully cracked the big one yet. Trying. Are you? Trying? Ask the real question. Are you shopping offers on the street? Just to get it out of the way, let me apologize for anything that might have offended at the poker tournament. Now that I'm at Treasury, I need to find someone to steward my firm. I'm already stewarding a firm, a bigger one. - Not that size matters. - Right. Whatever Axe's flaws, one thing he knows is people, and if he believes you can do it well, I believe you can. And I'd actually be hands off. Let you operate as you saw fit. That's my situation now. Is it? I said no. With finality or as a negotiating ploy? Look, I know it's Axe's faith that confers value on me until I have a track record of my own, until others actually see what I can do. So I am loyal to him. Until and unless it becomes necessary, I will not leave. All right. You can take the heat. I believe you. Such disrespect. Look at you, sitting here with your tits out. You got a problem with my tits? Or maybe they're turning you on and that's the problem. You know, I could have done that for myself. I know. I wanted the release. It was even better than a hand job.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A man who believes he'll win at trial sits calmly on the sidelines for six months until his money is unfrozen, and then he prevails in court, goes on with his life. But a man who thinks he's going to lose that trial? Well, he's desperate to get his money back in the game as soon as possible because he sees it all going away. Him giving up trading would necessitate a reinvention of who he is. I've seen him walk away from the table on an impulse when we were certain that only a deal would keep him out of prison. No one gets where he got by acting only on impulse. When it comes to billionaires and Bobby Axelrod in particular, the thing you got to understand is... they're meat-eaters. The only win they can live with is total, present and future. If he gave up trading and got his money back, it'd be because he believed he was gonna kick our asses at trial. He expects to get all of it, everything. That's who he is.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, boy. Okay, break it down for me. We are the Czechoslovakian gymnastics team in the '70s. A lot of pride for what this country was, but if something doesn't change soon, defections are coming. How'd Taylor do? Fine. - I'm not asking you to rat. - I mean, you are. Well, I won't tell anyone it came from you, but... It was a shit show. Yeah. Get me Taylor, Wags, and Wendy. Why the fuck did you lead the first morning meeting back without Wendy there to handle the troops? - Taylor handled it, as well... - I'm talking to both of you, and from what "Dollar Bill" tells me, it was a shit show. - Hey, you ratted. - I pay for the information. It's mine to use. That's how it goes. Wendy wasn't here. She was with you, I gather. We needed ideas. We needed to come together... So you made a bad thing worse by jumping in - before you had a plan, and... - No, Axe. It wouldn't have mattered who was in the room with the PMs and the traders. It was always gonna be a shit show if the message wasn't "We're liquid again." - Hallelujah. - Don't be an ass. You're right. I meant Axe, but you, too, Bill. Will you leave us alone for a minute? Whoever you're trying to destroy, stop. You need to focus on fighting for your freedom. You know what you're suggesting I do. The one thing you can do right now. You taught me an average trader makes a trade and feels good. A great trader makes a trade and feels nothing, as in be cold and act. Don't get hung up on emotion. Give up trading till the case is over. You get it back if you win. If you lose, you've got bigger problems. Let them trade for you, then feed the press a line about how it proves the government has no case. Unless you're worried about something harder to admit, that Taylor will be the public face of Axe Cap and not you. It's Theseus's Ship. Once you change out the sails and all the planks that make up the hull, whose ship is it? Yeah. You got it. As long as it's your money, it is still Axe Capital, no matter who's making the day-to-day decisions. Are you sure? It's not me that has to be sure.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IoT, you know? Sure, Internet of Things. When companies that make appliances and digital thermostats contract with the firms that manufacture the microchips to make their products smart, the connected things inside, they force the chip companies to sign nondisclosures. They don't want their competitors - to be able to mimic them. - Right, so it's hard to know which chip companies are poised to dominate the market. My theory: If we could find a common component among a bunch of varied devices... You could reverse-engineer it. You have fun smashing shit apart? A blast. And I found a component that matched the specs for a Quartes chip. So I called Quartes and claimed to be building an Internet-connected washing machine that sends a message to the owner when the laundry is done. Got the full specs on their latest chips. - And they matched. - That they did. Everyone tries to hide it, but Quartes is the main supplier for 85% of IoT products on the market. So, that's the shot? That's the shot. It plays. Good work. You'd have found something like it if you weren't... That's why I have you, Taylor. It's a good thing that you can deliver when I can't, not a bad thing. - Thank you. - Once you leave here, we can't really talk individual names of companies again for a long time. Management issues, sure, but not stocks. It'll all be up to you. I can't be seen to be guiding the firm. It'll look as though I'm violating the terms of my deal. I know. You saved the firm by doing what you did. We bought back into the market late in the position. Tonight's a big one for me. The most important managers in the business will be there. Between them, they cover all the meaningful strategies currently in play. Quite the cotillion. It's the social event of the season. Tonight plants our flag for the future. This room will set the agenda for what the industry's talking about for the next week, month, year. And what they will be talking about is Axe Capital.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bobby. Are you okay? <i>I went down to the crossroads.</i> What? <i>I made a mistake.</i> The deal. I can't do it... not trade. <i>I've worked my entire life</i> putting myself in a position where I would be truly free... no limits, nothing I couldn't do. And with one signature, I've stripped myself of all of that. It wasn't the signature that did it. It was the living like there were no rules. That's what made the signature necessary. Wendy? You all right? Yeah. Don't wake up the kids. I'll be right up. I can't do this now. <i>Realize that limits,</i> <i>constraints, they can be useful.</i> <i>Letting someone else run Axe Capital gives you</i> <i>a chance to realign who you are.</i> To get good at letting go. Which is a different kind of freedom. A more powerful kind of freedom. <i>Now go to sleep.</i> <i>Even if it were a good idea, which it's not,</i> <i>there is nothing you can do to regain control at this hour.</i>

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We need to meet. These fuckers can take away my ability to trade but not my ability to see. Insightful guy like you, how you gonna turn it off? I'm not. I can't. I don't want to. If you can't trade on the insights, who can? Only those who I have reason to trust absolutely. - And that's me. - It better be. Because no one can know I'm behind <i>any</i> of these trades. Well, our doors wouldn't be open if it wasn't for your, um, let's say goodwill. And when we're done, those doors are gonna open on to a much bigger shop. Been hoping to hear from you. I've been wanting to expand, but I've never been great at the raise. That'll no longer be a problem for Old Oaks Investments. Your money is always good here. You can't direct funds, so how's this work? Let's dive the fuck in. I'll be in touch.

 

 

 

 

 

WENDY RHOADES TO CHUCH, DURING JUDGE SITUATION FOR AXE CASE It's about will, Chuck. Impose your will on him until he does what he needs to and repays the debt.

 

 

 

 

<i>Yeah, what is it?</i> My maid was late today. She's never late. We have a real problem. We need to meet. Group of guys who own this car, it's a smaller club than the one that owns NBA teams, only 29 ever built. Which is exactly why I'm buying it. Which is why I'm gonna let you outbid me. Thanks. Sounds like you want something. I do. I want in on the new shit. You're raising money for new ventures, count me in. Thanks, but I'm not looking to give up any more equity. You're saying no to money? Look, Axe, let me answer the question you didn't ask, and this pains me to say... I don't want <i>your</i> money. I've got too many eyes on me, and I can't be anywhere near the shit show you're in the middle of right now. Noted. Michael Panay. You haven't gone home with a car this year. Is it the one you had your heart set on all along? If Bill Thomas built a toaster, I'd skip work to buy that. But you won't actually buy this car, will you? Because you've been downsizing, hoping no one would see. We're not downsizing. I was on the other side of the Alperin trade. I know how much you lost. Well, I know you're not exactly trending in the right direction, either. Maybe we help each other. I lead the early bidding, knock out the dabblers, then you swoop in at your desired price. What's your number? Mike, I'd pedal the fucking Flintstones car before I went in on this with you. You sure? I know my people. She's been approached. I'll handle it. You know what this means, don't you? They'll be coming for the others.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR DISCUSSING TRADE ON BRAZIL TSUNAMI We're getting hit by a tsunami. - Shit. Did the Fed hike... - No. Actual tsunami. In Brazil. No way. Brazil doesn't have tsunamis. The worst they get is <i>ressacas do mar.</i> "Sea hangover." Am I the only person here who's loved a Portuguese woman? Brazil does not normally have tsunamis. Black swan event. How heavy are we in Brazil? Jim Morrison at the end. Our newly redeployed funds are affected in dozens of different ways, among the most notable, - Brazilian sugar and shipping. - So we buy sugar futures. Impending shortage means prices go up. Everyone will do that, but sure. A few of the moves I'm already making. Shorting Brazil's largest debt holder, buying long-dated VIX calls. Also buying solar, wind, and every alternative energy play not dependent on government subsidy. Um, is no one worried about the people, you know, <i>in</i> Brazil? If you want to pretend you're concerned, see Wendy. He's not pretending, Wags. If you really care, start a walk-a-thon. Tough Mudders are the new walk-a-thons. But don't bring that shit to me. Our own foundation was set up for just these situations as a kind of emotional and fiscal catch-all for you to use as a tool for you to get your conscience out of the way. I wondered why you showed at this meeting, you fucking vulture. What would salve my conscience and my wallet is if I was a fucking contractor in Brazil. Too bad their leading construction company's a scandal factory. Can't get into bed with a firm that's had almost 100 executives indicted. <i>Our</i> principal has been indicted. If it's a money-maker, we do it. Legal trouble does not mean you can't fulfill your teleological purpose. We're on the clock, people. Now's the time to earn your paychecks.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Axe would be out on that floor screaming at them like Gordon Ramsay until they delivered. Hm. You're more Alton Brown. The ideas they're bringing... Some deployable, some useful as a benchmark of what other firms will be thinking and how we need to do better, but none platonically good. Your first round of investments coinciding with your first crisis. That would be a lot for anybody. Axe was already considering sidecarring two billion. And you think today will make the decision for him. I am acutely aware of the way people look at me. I have cultivated, through achievement and discipline, a mystique that compensates for my lack of track record. A loss shatters that, and with it the confidence of everyone who works here. In their eyes... in Axe's eyes... I become simply inexperienced. I can't let that happen. That's why I need to get through today unscathed. The way you think Axe would. It's important in your job that you face unpleasant realities. Axe Capital may lose money today, probably will. You know that, right? No.

Wags, I'm coming in. The place is getting crushed without me. Can I stop you? No. You sure I can't stop you? You know that painting of Washington crossing the Delaware. In the boat with all his troops? I forget what it's called. I think it's called Washington Crossing The Delaware... - You didn't forget. - No. And do you know why it's called that? Because at the moment that his troops were facing the sting of battle, Washington was right there with them, leaning into the wind. Not back at home jerking off. I'll admit, Washington Crossing the Delaware would look pretty fucking strange without George Washington. Then how can you ask me not to be with my troops right now? Well, Washington was allowed to talk to his men. He was allowed to lead. When we walk out of this elevator, you're gonna see it is quite a different situation. But it is what's required under your deal. This is Ari Spyros, Director of Compliance and Risk Management for Axe Capital. It's 12:09 p.m. I am here with Robert Axelrod and will stay with him anywhere he goes inside these walls, ensuring compliance with his preclusion from the secur... I'm looking at small sugar companies in Asia. We pick one... invest in it, grow it, help it. Not a big fan of... Oh, shit. What do you think he'd say about that? Bobby Axelrod doesn't grow mom-and-pop shops. He buys 'em out, <i>turns</i> 'em out. That can't happen with this one. Hmm. Well, then it sounds like your idea doesn't fucking work.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why didn't you anticipate the tsunami? Maybe I should have when that underground earthquake hit off Mozambique. Strange conditions bring strange results. That's what brought this on. You knew right then but you couldn't act. Maybe you would have used your experience to think more globally. Maybe you would have been cautious. De-risked. The mature move. Is that a dig? It's not. You have more experience. You connect points I don't even know to look for. I understand how hard it is to have things inside you that you can't communicate. I can't imagine how hard it must be to know how to say them and still not be allowed to. And yet, you are not allowed to. Have you heard me direct any trades? The people out there don't know who they're looking to. Since it can't be you, it needs to be me. If you can't live with that, I can be the one who leaves. You'll probably make up the losses but get yourself banned for life or worse. I'm leaving, and I'm taking the two billion. I'll send instructions shortly about what to do with it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I didn't like you kicking me out. I apologize if I was rude. I don't give a fuck about rude. It showed you were distracted. How did we do today? Just executed a huge PIPE. We're going to arb a Southeast Asian sugar company. Fun. If all my projections hold, we're still down five percent overall. Anyone else would have lost 12 or done something stupid to get even. Booking the loss was the only way. I'm not pulling the two billion. It's yours to invest. I really thought you didn't trust me. That's why you were in the office looking over everyone's shoulder. I was in the office, because as of now, I don't know what else to do with myself. And... as much as I can trust anyone with my name and my money... I trust you. I am irrelevant. You want the money because you want the stake, the control. You need the game to remember who you are. I've decided how I'm going to invest that two billion. I'm going to diversify, invest in outside funds. I'll hear pitches, among them your hand-picked favorites. And after I give them the money, I'm going to be a passive investor. Thank you. You're not doing this 'cause I need it. <i>You</i> need it. You're giving me a place to play so I stay off your field. And you want the benefit of my moves on our bottom line in case there's another disaster. I'm your hedge.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Were you followed? I took precautions. This place was like a sanctuary for me when I was a kid. The game is different now. Rules have changed, you know? Back when I'd come in here, the only way your opponent could get ball in hand was if you hit the ball off the table. Not anymore. Any scratch at all, you can pick it up, place the cue ball wherever he wants. Ball in hand. You give a good pool player that kind of advantage, your game's as good as over. Bobby, plenty of game left. Is there? Here. Good. I'll get you out faster with this to surrender. Well, you've had plenty of clients right where I am. What do they tell their kids? I got no fucking clue what to say to my boys. No one ever does. At least, not in advance. But, uh, you're a good father. When the instant arrives, you will. Remind them that they know who you really are, no matter what anyone says.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look, guys, you probably have some questions about why I'm here. I'm going to be arrested today. - What? - Shh. Shh. For now, here's all you need to know. The government is gonna say that I did something wrong. But the government is a bunch of fucking liars, guys. Listen. Look, that's not true. Sometimes they lie. Sometimes they tell the truth, just like everyone... like me. Most folks, they find this out about their dad much later, but everyone finds it out. I'm a flawed man. And I'm not perfect. I'm not always right. I don't always win. I fucked up. I did do something wrong. If that makes me a bad person, well, you'll have to decide that for yourselves, not just once, but many times more as you grow older and you learn more. But know this. I'm still your dad. And I am gonna fight. I'm gonna try really hard to win this, but I might not. But we don't give up. We won't give up either, Dad. Come here. Be good boys like I know you can be. Listen to your mother. We love you, Dad. Okay. Come on. - See you next time. - Okay.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can turn around. I always figured the worst part about being locked up would the company. You've just proven me right. Oh, I bet the worst is yet to come. You made a mistake coming here. - Really? - Yeah. Once Boyd showed up at my door, I knew you were in this, that you'd used him to hook me in. Yeah. He went off book there. And you just affirmed the whole thing, that you entrapped me. I<i> trapped</i> you. Oh, there's an important legal difference. Well, I won't be in here for long. No. A<i> macher</i> like you? You'll make bail. But it won't feel like freedom for a long time, maybe ever again. I might have underestimated a part of your character. - Really? - Yeah. I didn't realize just how desperate you were to feel like a man. You sacrificed over, what, 27 million dollars, every penny you had, just to catch me? And almost broke your father and your best friend in the process. I may be ruthless when it comes to dealmaking, but you're as trigger happy as Machine Gun Kelly, spraying everyone in sight. Well, that may be. But, I'll tell you, when I think about all that money I lost, just to see you in this place, all I can say is... worth it! I hope so. Because the moment I walk out that door, I am never coming back, even if I have to spend a hundred... fuck it, a thousand times what you did, to make sure. Tell yourself that. Maybe that'll help you on all those sleepless nights you have staring you in the face. Nah, it won't matter. No amount of money is gonna erase the video of all those lackeys you poisoned, or wipe out the trading records of your tampering with the stock, manipulating the market. You let your hatred of me put everything you hold dear in jeopardy. I'm gonna find it. Whatever it is. Whatever thread you left behind, however small... the one that threatens everything you are. We both know it's out there. You know exactly what it is. You were talking about sleepless nights. It's what you'll wake up thinking about in the dark, shaking, because I'm gonna find it. You know I will. And I am gonna pull on it, and I'm gonna pull on it until your whole fucking world unravels. And when I am done, you won't be governor. You won't be the U.S. Attorney. You might not even be an attorney at all. Yeah, I might go down behind all of this, but one thing is for sure, you are gonna be right there next to me. Wow. Like I said before, Bob... worth it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR INTERVIEWING THE QUANT Please describe the nature of your approach to the market and how your algorithms serve that end. Boring. What the fuck kind of way is that to kick off an interview? I'm rejecting the premise or flipping the script. <i>I</i> should interview<i> you.</i> For what, the school newspaper? Yassss, Queen. Good one, but no. I've got offers from half the funds on the Street and several tech firms out West, and they pay guarantees, not bonuses. Now, don't get me wrong. I've heard about Taylor Mason. Love to see if you live up to the hype, but I've got options. So, let me put this in your language: What's in it for<i> moi?</i> You Patrick Bateman/Bud Fox hybrid wannabe. He was doing Spader in<i> Wall Street.</i> But I don't care about his insulting tone. I only care about his ability to think clearly and rationally under pressure. You're not thinking of hiring him? She's no fool. No. But, sadly, though you may have a genius-level I.Q., you have no control over your emotional state. That's why you're lashing out in here, defensive, allowing your rage at yourself to manifest in boorish, childish behavior. He couldn't figure out the box, so he did that to it. Then he let the rest of his bullshit cloud his thinking. He has no idea why he had to resort to brute force, so he doesn't get to work here. Take your feet off the table and get the fuck out of our office.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Axe Making Deal with Michael as he cannot touch money to trade. I used to love visiting museums when I was a young man, back before I could afford the paintings. Now I'd rather look at 'em on my walls. I'm selling all my shit. You were right at the car auction. I am barely hanging on. Redemptions are starting to hit in a big way. It doesn't matter anyway. I never knew what was any good about my collection. I just bought what the art advisor told me to. That's one way to go. I can't imagine what I sound like. You sound like a guy who's had a rough couple of years. Happens to everyone. I'll have to shutter soon. What are you walking with? 40. I guess I can live on that. Can you? Got the city apartment, the Hamptons place, Beaver Creek. The debt service and running the properties is ten a year. You'll have to start your new family office. There's a lease, an analyst or two, an assistant, an accountant. You got private school, your daughter's horse, you got charity. You can't dip below two a year on that, or you lose your board seats and your wife loses all her friends. You can forget flying wheels up from now on. You're sucking it up in commercial. You'll hold on to your driver until it kills you, but... soon, he'll be gone, too. Fuck! I'm broke. What would you give to get it back? Your status, all your money, the whole thing. Anything. My leg. My spleen. An inch off my dick. Well, then this is the best day of your new life, 'cause I got a line on an orphaned two billion looking for a home, and I can get you in the room to pitch for it. All you have to do is say yes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How'd you know not to bet me? Win, lose 100, who gives a shit? You have more money than god. I didn't get it by wagering against Willie Mosconi. You were gonna sandbag me. Let me win a few games, then double the bet, then run me down. I didn't even bring my own cue. If you had, maybe I'd have gone for it, counting on that special vanity that a man with a custom cue has. Once you started chalking up, no chance. Oh. Thanks, Chef Ryan. Mm. Last time I had a burger this good... Remember that time down in Atlanta, with Killer Mike? That was right before I gave Axe Capital that extra half-billion from my fund. Good anchoring technique. No. But no matter how tasty, I'm not sure I can give the same treatment to Michael Panay. There is no linkage to me, so that solves the first problem. But he will listen to me and invest exactly as I instruct, so that solves problem two. Yeah, but he's on a bad run, Axe. He's bleeding out. But you got a surgeon stepping in. I know that, but my board can't. I got to hard-sell this guy to them. Well, get Panay to convince them. Get him in front of that board. You sure? It's hard to defend numbers like his. He's presentable. Let's get him in here and see. Panay! Looks like I'm not the only sandbagger in here. Mike, this is Raul. - He's gonna take you in. - Not unless you can tell me why you ran your fund into the ground. They'll expect some answers. He'll have answers. Just show strength and pitch them your best three ideas, which I'll give you. And if anybody steps in your face... Kick 'em in the cock. Okay. I'll wear sharp shoes. All right. I'll let you know when we've booked a meeting. So? I might be able to sell him. But why would I?

 

 

 

 

 

I must be out of my fucking mind. Oh, I disagree. I think you're showing some real nuance in your thinking, which is what is required since you have suffered at the hands of some very devious opponents in Rhoades and his father. Yeah, well, I'm here for some goddamned reason, so, uh, what is it you want to propose? That I acquire your virtually worthless shares in Ice Juice for considerably over market. 30 million dollars. A firm called Ionosphere would paper the transaction. In return, you forgo your civil suit and refuse to testify against me. You'll give my people a statement laying out how Rhoades did what he did. Your best friend sold you down the river for nothing. He's not worth saving. I'm willing to pay you 30 million to tell the truth. It's just a transaction to you, this whole thing? Numbers move from here to there, and emotions are smoothed out, like ice under a Zamboni. No, I understand what's fair. And I know how to make a deal. So, take your life back. Gary? While you're at it, go ahead and pick one. On my tab. Why should she have to suffer?

 

 

 

 

 

 

How does it work? What am I missing? We'll get back to that. Résumé says you were at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 20 years. The most rewarding job a data scientist could ask for. And now finance. Why? The stock market is representation of the psychology of the entire world at any given moment. Data is an exact thumbprint of that moment. I get to know what the world is thinking and feeling and what it will do next. What a refreshing, excellent answer. Yes. Would you be willing to let me test it so I can observe it under market conditions? Of course. I'll give you access for the day, and you'll be able to see how it works. It doesn't fit together, right? You're testing the ability to realize that, the confidence to admit it? Outstanding.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR WITH WAGS, NASA QUANT PLOY It's been a pleasure, but this isn't going to work out. But the algo performed beautifully. Yeah, his algo performed beautifully. You know I'm no fan, but even I can see... I could go into specifics, but it's just not what we're looking for. The NDAs have all been signed, and your model expired at the close today, so... I wish you well. I spotted the back door he put in, the one that would allow us to support our plays retroactively with legit-seeming data. Really? And I know that you somehow organized it. Is that how desperate you are to avoid quants? That you try to rig it to blunt them and try to float it past me without telling me? Of course not. I... All right, how'd you know? Your body language, the softball questions, the register of your voice. But the only thing I can't figure out is why. Do you know how Axe and I met, what the source of my loyalty to that man is? I don't. Well, I was at Lehman the last time a bunch of brilliant kids thought that they had solved the fucking secrets of the market. It almost cost me everything that I had built over my entire career. The rest of us, we were at their mercy because we didn't understand what they were doing, so we couldn't question it. It was a chance meeting with Axe at a golf outing wherein he read my tarot cards for me, told me what was gonna happen. I was able to sell at 50. If I had waited a few more months, it would have been at two. Axe's warning allowed me to save my ass before it was too late. I do not want to be in that position ever again. I see. Even though your former company was levered 31 times and there were countless other factors at play, I get how traumatic that was. So you're not gonna hire a quant? I am not going to hire a quant. That's become clear to me. And you're correct. Billy Beane never won a World Series. But Theo Epstein did, using all the same strategies Billy came up with first, and we will, too. I accept I can't go outside to find what we need, so we're going to build our own. I'm going to oversee it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

AXE WITH PENA AFTER PENA GETS PENSION FUND DEAL DUE TO AXE Who are you? Hey! Hey, stop! Hi, Mike. Good job winning the board over. Axe? I am here to set the terms. I thought. Well, of course you did. But. You will move assets how and when I tell you. Your 2 and 20 is now 1 and 10. The rest will be converted into cryptocurrency and paid to me. You will sign documents testifying to your full and willing participation in all of this right now. Those documents will disappear from sight, but they'll always exist. The gentlemen here will help you handle the details. You have been brought back to life, as promised. But it's not free. You can refuse right now, right here, but then everything will go away. Are you in? Are you in? Good. Then all is as it should be in the world. You are now officially but unofficially the proud owner of half of my half of Panay's fund, paid in crypto, of course.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is some advanced real estate play. Let the Saudis keep 432 Park. This is the real prize. The last burial plot in Manhattan. And all the time to enjoy it. Only 350,000, and this cool slice of earth is mine. Well... and long may it remain unoccupied. Mr. Axelrod. We have eyes on the three labs in the Tri-State area capable of production and storage - of the Ice Juice toxicant. - FBI is interviewing the lead techs at each of them. - They'll be onto ours soon. - By the time they get to our lab, make sure there is no lab. Got it. What else? Dake is protecting Rhoades. Ira Schirmer saw it firsthand. He also saw that Connerty, if properly armed, won't let up. You have the Schirmer affidavit? Deliver it tonight? Go arm him, gents.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bobby Axelrod. Oscar Langstraat. - I know who you are. - Good to finally - meet you in person, Bobby. - You too. So you, um, you flew in private to worry about a cure for overheated Southern Africa? Well, my plane runs on recycled corn oil, so it's all good. Ah. That's what I have my masseuse use too. You're not as bad at this as the articles say. - At what? - Small talk. But I can see it's work for you. Look, these charities have basically become feel good machines. You gave ten mill. They'll say thanks. They'll ask again. You'll give again. But at the coming board meeting I'm pitching a drastic shift. I think that World-Aid should<i> own</i> the company that makes the solar panels. - Rayveon Solar. - Right. That way, when the panels go into wide use, World-Aid itself profits from it, grows, becomes self-sustaining. Venture Philanthropy. There's some of that disruption you're famous for. Disruption works. It's uncomfortable but effective. - Like rolfing. - I don't know. You might be able to sell that shit out by the Bay, but... Venture Philanthropy is the future. I sought you out because I want your support when I bring this to the board. My support isn't gonna help. The folks on the World-Aid board, they aren't in it for the future. They like the access and the status it gives them. And they don't want to lose it. Their risk tolerance is exactly zero. Coach Tikhonov in Lake Placid. That's a sport ball analogy, right? Ok. The future hurts. But only once. Denying it stings forever. Like Shelob in Cirith Ungol. Oh, that's a Middle Earth/fantasy analogy, right? Ok. But the board doesn't take to outsiders telling them how to do their job. I bear an unpleasant communiqué: Due to your legal entanglements, the chairman has asked that<i> I</i> represent the Axelrod Foundation on the dais... in your stead. I remember a time when ten million got you on the main stage... Go ahead, Ayles. And there it is: The only person the board mistrusts more than someone like you, is me. But I'm still on the board. So I'll consider your proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

<i>I want you to introduce Taylor</i> - to Rayveon Solar. - The solar panels... If we can make the World-Aid board invest, that stock will go through the roof. So we need to be in position. It's gonna be huge. And I want it in the main fund when I'm back. - Then it'll be done. - I can't be seen as steering Taylor, so put it in front of them. But don't. What if we have Ayles do it? Dress it up like it's charity. He's the most subtle man we've got. - Yeah. Good. - Yeah, but what if Taylor senses you're behind it? Will they steer away? Well, all depends on what has the stronger pull: fear or money. We'll find out when we find out. Eventually, all comes clear. Speaking of eventuality... somebody got cozy in my forever-bed before I had the chance to secure it. Can I use your team of ninjas to help me find out who? You know they're kind of occupied with bigger shit right now. But... what could be bigger than your eternal resting place? Go ahead.

 

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR AND MAFFEE DURING SHORT OF SPACE COMPANY <i>The countdown clock is</i> <i>T-minus eight hours to launch</i> <i>on tech titan Craig Heidecker's first ride into space</i> <i>and to the International Space Station.</i> <i>This is the first stage in Heidecker's ambitious plan</i> <i>for an eventual manned mission to Mars.</i> <i>Heidecker acquired...</i> And the papers want to know whose shirts he wears. How did we ever think to short that smile? His charm is a liability. It means people believe whatever he tells them. And he believes it, too. It ends up having a washing machine effect. The stock will, pardon me, skyrocket once he hard-docks at the Space Station. Size it down? Farpoint scrubbed the last three launches. Guidance and navigation each time, no corrections found. Another scrub sets them back two years. Stock will dump, and they'll be extra cautious with the CEO aboard... Size up on the short. I will. Can I be honest? I'll be honest. I'm rooting for him to get there. I am too. First step is the ISS. Next, space colonization. My bet is against his business model. Not his vision. Right on.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Legend is, King Cole is releasing his royal air under that robe. That's why he smiles. Because the jesters have to take it. It's a gesture of respect that we alerted you in advance of your removal. And what a kindness that is. Yet it's of a different style than the one I showed you. My support of our worthy cause. My fucking ten million. Look, Bobby. It's your board-appointed right to appear at the meeting. But you know how things leak. I wouldn't want you to be portrayed as desperate and begging. I'm a problem for you. Your board thrives in the dark, slurping up the fringe bennies... the five star lunches, the golf junkets, the safaris under the guise of "fact finding missions." My presence shines an unwanted light, 'cause I'm someone who actually works for a living. The conduct of the board, under<i> your</i> direction, will be found out. And nothing will change. Because that's how it's been for all time. Mm. A little cronyism greases the wheels of the machine. And no T-shirt Billie with the law on his tail is going to change that. Fart in my fucking presence and your reign will meet a swift end.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to push the final item to the top of the agenda. Changing the agenda requires a unanimous vote. I'll expedite: you don't have it. Fine. First order. Oscar Langstraat, one of our most important donors, would like to address the board regarding a... Venture Philanthropy initiative. Thank you. I value your good works. But organizations must change, because the world is changing. Venture Philanthropy, conducted with precision and care, is that change. We'll need those tents in here, you keep pumping in the fucking hot air. There'll be no crosstalk. So<i> I'll</i> just talk. Venture Philanthropy can work. But it requires a rigorous level of oversight. This group isn't built for that. Then what are we built for, Axelrod? Listen, Langstraat, I'd love to let you burn them, in the name of burnishing your own rep. But I cannot let you hurt the people of sub-Saharan Africa just so you can be part of yet one more cutting edge movement. Wake up, Axelrod. Cystic fibrosis is on the verge of being treatable, or even curable, thanks to VP. They've created a way to earn the money they need for research instead of endlessly fundraising. Look. Don't try and reinvent who we are, here. There is a reason for the tried and true... it may not be perfect, but it works. Look, you will make fools of yourselves. A 50 million dollar investment in Rayveon Solar would allow the people to bypass Africa's failed electric grid in the way cellphones bypassed its phone lines. They'll be able to power homes, businesses, indoor farms... Like the bard says: save the bold moves for the brilliant players. That ain't you. And it sure as shit isn't anybody sitting around this table. Spoken like the overpaid day trader you are. So says the fucking Northern California pipe dreamer. Don't do it, people. Mr. Langstraat's proposal goes to a vote. Those in favor of establishing a fund for the purpose of venture investment. As I, for one, certainly am... You're making a bigtime fucking mistake... The motion passes. As will, I expect, the next. I motion to remove Robert Axelrod from the World-Aid Consortium Board of Directors. Those in favor. The Board thanks you for your contribution.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do you carry this model? The 5270R in rose gold. We do have one. Perpetual Calendar chronograph. Silvery Opaline dial. Day, month and leap year in apertures. Moon phase... Sapphire-crystal case back with hinged dustcover. Fold-over clasp in 18 karat rose gold. 164,400 dollars. You're welcome to try it on... I'll take it. Nice piece. I'd forgotten what your voice sounds like. Because I only heard it through Wags. Ayles. You had them work me on the tent initiative... The message was received. I saw the play. Well enough to act on it? I bought a basket of solar to obscure it... ten names... including Rayveon. Good. The board approved the venture fund. Rayveon Solar is churning panels out of Shenzhen right now. Your play all along. Get the board to expand the initiative. Axe Cap reaps the win on manufacturing. Your aim is true. So is mine. Heidecker. Farpoint stock price went the way of its founder. Our short paid big. About halfway through your screed, I realized: You weren't insulting me. We were dancing. Well, I couldn't rid myself of my toxicity so I aimed it. For my benefit. They hate you so much, they forgot that they hate me too. Thank you for throwing the vote my way. My pleasure. Oh, I imagine it is. I'm guessing you laid a healthy position in Rayveon Solar in advance of the outcome. Oh, no, I don't trade equities. I do. Oscar, my CIO, Taylor Mason. Did you buy in yourself? I don't burn from both ends. It's in the interest of my brand to be above reproach. Well, I don't have that luxury... or burden. The fund really is to World-Aid's benefit. They'll never know the good you did them. To the good we've done. And will do. Do you know why Ethiopians eat this way? Shared? In the center? It's to foster a sense of community. Keep everything in the open. So everyone sees how much is available. And everyone knows they got their fair share. It keeps everyone honest... We've all done well today. All got our portion. But you two might be better suited to a steakhouse. Where everyone has his own plate. Plenty such establishments in Mountain View. And I'd be happy to host. You two would find fruit in our humble valley. I'll leave this to you two to carve up.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Imagine being so heartless that you continue to put tumors in living creatures even after you know the drug wasn't working. No profit is worth that. Only a monster would profit from an animal's misery and death. And it's illegal! Well, we're gonna blow the whistle, loud and long. And I'm going to get you whistleblower protection. I've already got the attorneys all lined up. We need to go quickly. They're trying to get one more stock bump before it becomes public that... Here's a little something to tide you over in the fallout from your testimony against Mendham. Waiting for anyone? Wheels-up as soon as I hit the chair. EDNY just grilled Dr. Gilbert. We tracked them interdicting every doctor you've gone to or made a donation to. When they got to Gilbert... We knew we had to pull you off the plane. I was really fucking looking forward to the City by the Bay. You want your slide back from my lab or... No. Get rid of it for me. For your foundation. <i>The slide.</i> <i>What did he do with the slide?</i> Fingerprints live for years. Decades. Offering it up would give him massive bargaining power with the Feds. You were right to intercept me. I need to see him. You can't cancel. I mean, you can, but tomorrow's opportunities will be subscribed with or without you. I'll send my CIO. Taylor Mason. You've met. <i>Sure did. Smart person.</i> Didn't seem like a fan of me or my work, but... Well, we jerked them around a little. So they felt jerked around. But trust me, they are a huge Oscar Langstraat fan. <i>Don't make me spend time with that guy...</i> VCs are just hedge fund managers who can quote the <i>Tibetan Book Of The Dead.</i> Well, he has the pick of the best investments out there. I need to manage our investments<i> here.</i> Axe Cap goes wherever you do.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHUCK FINDS ABOUT AXE,DOC CONNECTION IN DONNIE'S DEATH Wend. I just heard from Dake. Whatever it is, however bad, say it... I can't unsee what I saw when I read your session notes. And something in them may be the key to making sure that you and I don't go down. But Axe does. I can't unsee it. And I know it's, uh... What almost ended our marriage? Yes. But the information... Axe convinced a doctor not to give that experimental treatment to Donnie Caan, to shorten the man's life. He may have used the same doctor in his Ice Juice poisoning. You didn't put the doc's name in the session notes. I didn't have it. I don't. I'm gonna have to go to Donnie's widower to get the name. That's what I woke you to say. And if it makes you feel better to tell me not to, do so, right now. But I promise not to listen.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TAYLOR AND DOLLAR BILL ABOUT SHORTING SOME PHARMA STOCK You got me. I'm here with Dollar Bill. He wants to short... Mendham Pharmaceuticals. They're about to draw the ire of the libtards for cruelty and the Street for missing targets. You use that word so I feel rage and then tell myself not to allow that <i>to make me predisposed against your idea. Smart.</i> And would work if I hadn't studied Agrippa, which I have. Regardless, I support this if Compliance approves. <i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Axe. I've been calling. And I haven't been answering. Don't you think that's maybe a sign it's not a good time? You won't believe the bullshit that's going on in your name. - Spyros is blocking me... - Unsafe. Use the proper channels. I don't know where the ears are. Strip or Retire! What? "Strip or Retire." That's the motto that was carved above the palestra in ancient Athens. Where they wrestled in the nude... This is getting weird, Bill... It means every man should have skin in the game. His rep, his honor, fully on the line because it means all. Like mine. You think you can't trust me, you're wrong. Show me the wire, Bobby! - Huh, where is it? - Bill. This is public. Very public. And we look like we're having a lovers' tiff, at best. Now, I got an important fucking meeting to go to. So pull up your pants and stop looking to me for help. Help yourself.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to Daniel. I've prepared a wonderful tasting menu for you tonight. Enjoy your evening, and bon appétit. Thanks for opening up for us, Daniel. Good to see you, Axe... Full restaurant buyout. Impression made, Mr. Axelrod! And Daniel of all places! The precision of that man's kitchen is mesmerizing. Puts me in mind of a formicarium I built as a kid. That where you jerked off? Ant farm... He knows it's an ant farm. That's some white burg... ...fleshy yellow apple, notes of starfruit... Enough of that. Spyros, tell me what you see as the difference between your old job and your new one. Ah. Well. As you know, my career at the SEC was rather distinguished. I attribute that to one thing: integrity. Which I now bring with me as I walk the other side of the same street for you. Where I once policed violations, I now prevent them... Wrong. One word: risk. Inside the government there is none. Every action, every moment is backed by the full power and credit... suspect as that may be... of the United States of America. Everything is all fucking covered by Big State. Like a plump bosomed wet nurse. But for us... and for you too now... everything is on the line. We don't feel like coming into work one morning, we make a series of fucked up calls... the lights get shut and we are on the balls of our asses. Testify! But what do we get for taking all that risk? Capital. Value. It's why you drive that gorgeous German engineered sports car. She is a beautiful beast. No one wheeled one of those into your office at the SEC, no matter how good you were at that job. You know what those click monkeys are looking for, so while your title is Head of Compliance, you are really here to help manage that risk by pushing what we do right to the fucking edge. So instead of fucking with us, use what you learned in your<i> distinguished</i> career to help us. And Dollar Bill? Oh, he stepped out of line, so he doesn't get to do his deal... which'll hurt him more than paying retail. But no more of that him-or-me shit. Oh, and you don't threaten to turn us in. <i>Ever.</i> You are us now. And a man who turns on his own family, he turns on himself. You're better than that, aren't you Spyros? You never told me I was family. - Favorite son. - Like a brother. Then, yes. I will protect the family. But there is one thing that I need... I'm listening...

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

God's honest truth... I don't have the slide. By now whatever remains of the glass are ashes buried with tons of other biomedical waste. But we both know I don't need that slide to be a danger to you. I could just tell them the truth. But I've been pushed far enough. I want something for my troubles. Name it. Money. For your foundation? For me and my family. Two hundred million. I want to live a little. Okay. My people will take care of it. Well, I finally got my read: I'm fucked. He asked for money. But we know he doesn't<i> want</i> money. Especially for himself. He's made a deal with the government and he's stalling... <i>We are gonna find a compromise.</i> You're asking me to testify, I refuse... I don't see a position. Squint with me. If you don't want to get on the stand, then there needs to be physical evidence. <i>Is</i> there physical evidence? An item that could speak for you. If such a thing existed, I could make sure that it would appear where it needs to, and it would be the matador's sword. He would walk out of that court room right into his cell and you, my good doctor, would be free from all of this. Don't let your paranoia make you take unnecessary risks. Not unnecessary if they keep me out of jail. \_ They don't have the slide. God, you're slaying us. He'll roll it out at trial! The spotlight moves all over Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades. Several other witnesses have been tampered with. Tell me again how we have to leave Chuck out of this investigation. What is this really about for you? Next time you talk, there should be lawyers present.

 

 

 

 

 

 

You rattled? Do I look rattled? If you weren't a little rattled, you'd have come right to my office when you saw the top floor annexed like that. But you played it cool. You're right. I wouldn't use the word "rattled," but... The situation upstairs indicates increasing odds of a worst-case scenario. And you're sitting here trying to figure out what? It's on me to be ready to address any subsequent instability. You're wondering if Axe Capital can survive Axe himself going to jail. Yes. Not as we know it. It'll be about mutation. The capital will still need to be managed. The people here are capable and the right ones to do it. But can it thrive, grow, and continue to really live if Axe goes to jail? That'll come down to one thing. You know what that is. You. But that's not news to you. Because part of you wants that challenge, part of you is terrified of it, and part of you hates yourself for hoping he does go away, so you get a chance to see. Yes. Even now I measure myself against him, as though he were gone. And the thought of coming up short... Measurable successes are seductive. Especially when we're young. But when it comes to dealing with other human beings, we have to steer from instinct. I don't trust instinct. That's because you're defining it in some woo woo spiritual way. Don't. Instead, think of your gut as the deepest part of you, the part that can do internal calculations on the highest plane. Axe, at his best, does this. You want to be on his level, in the purest way, the most profound, then you must, too. Identify it. Separate it from your fears, your hopes, the other voices in your head. Because if you don't cultivate instinct, and listen to it... you're fucking doomed. You know what? Now I am rattled.

Bobby, they don't have the slide. Connerty's slow playing us. He'll roll it out at trial. Nope. If he were, this was the moment he would have produced it. So now, we run out the clock and game over. It's pretty to think so. When did you become a dyspeptic? When I started facing jail time. When did you become a fucking Pollyannic? You're convinced this evidence is out there, fine. Then tell me what you want me to do, because you're leaving me no options. You're not interested in taking a plea, you won't leave the country... What's the physical security like at the FBI evidence lock-up? - Come on. - State of the art. We'll look into it. Get back to me when you know more. We're almost home. Don't let your paranoia make you take unnecessary risks. Not unnecessary if they keep me out of jail.

Bobby, you and I... we ended up here, for now, but I know I didn't make a mistake about you when we met. About who you were. Who you are. And that guy would never give in, because that guy would never believe, even for one second, that he couldn't find a way to convince not one, but all twelve jurors to see things his way. Especially if it meant losing not only his freedom, but his family.

Oh, I should've known something like this was coming. Ballsy. Can we come in? Huh. You know, last time I saw you, you were behind bars. Tell me, does living in a space this palatial actually erase the memory of that badly lit cell in Brooklyn? Or maybe you just felt the need to swing your dick one last time in anticipation of a place far worse. You managed to get your foot caught in the rope tossing me overboard, there, Chuck. Now, I may pop to the surface, but you are going under. - Congratulations. - Enough. I didn't bring us all together so I could mediate your puerile bullshit. This is how we ended up here in the first place. Because the two of you, at your absolute fucking worst, went after each other like a couple of pit bulls. And now we're all three of us royally fucked, in a way that's so incestuous that if one of us goes to prison, we all do. Conversely, if we want to get ourselves out of this clusterfuck... It's one for all and all for one? Sit. Oh, she has you well-trained. Chuck, calm down. And I don't remember giving you permission to speak. Sit down. She is effective. Now, we are all going to sit here and calmly discuss how to undo this thing. And we're not leaving until we solve it. Yes? I'll discuss it. - Why I'm here. - Good. As much as you two fucking hate each other, your only objective right now is survival. And if you are going to save yourselves... and me... you both need to surrender your weapons. Empty the caches, all of it. It all goes on the table. Understood? How do I know I can trust him? How do I know I can trust him? Trust<i> me.</i> Uh, is it all right if I go to the bathroom? Yeah, sure. It's... down there. Take a left. Full transparency. I give you my word. You want transparency? How fucking clear is this?

. So we agree this thing can never go to trial. We all know what we're doing? My number one priority: Getting Wendy clear of her short position. That's my priority too. I believe you. But how? Connerty has my trade, from Spyros. Yeah. And the log with your visit to me. And he can draw that to look like many things: co-conspirator in your scheme... or mine... chief amongst them. And nobody will believe it was a marital tiff, which is what it was. Oh. You guys fight? Who'd've figured? Cell phone records will show me calling Mafee from Chuck's office. I'll handle that part. I have people who will work to... massage those records. My mouth is dry. Adrenaline leaving the body, right? Mm. So should we talk about the part we've been avoiding in front of her? You mean who we're dumping this on? That's right. When there's a body, as the corpus of this juice company most certainly is, there has to be a gunman in the depository window. Otherwise, they keep looking for the killer. Yeah. And there'd need to be a financial trail laid in, showing how he profited too. So that'll be your department. You've proven yourself quite adept at financial trickitude. <i>No one's</i> proven that, actually. Which is all the proof I need that you can pull this off. Well, I imagine I can... But we couldn't have this going to trial, with this person ending up on the stand revealing all the holes... No. He needs to be put in a mortal vise, so he takes a plea. That's the only way the pilot light on Eastern's case can be snuffed out completely. This player would need to be leveraged. Broken... That's dirty work. You have the stomach? Of a billygoat. When necessary. For her. For her. You think she can handle framing someone who didn't do it? Wendy's got steel in her, but I've never known her to go that far. No. So we're either gonna have to keep it from her or s... So who's going to be our patsy? Come on, boys, I think we all know someone needs to go down for this.

Mafee. What do you have there? These are açai bowls. They taste like dessert - but they're filled... - I asked Mafee. Oh. Right. I'll finish at my desk. Supposed to be healthy. I gotta start watching it now, I'm not a 20 year old laxer anymore... Lacrosse... right. I had football in my head somehow. No. Lax. Want some? Uh, maybe later. Good for you though. Taking the next step in your growth. Making a commitment to a healthy future. Even if it's the hard thing. Absolutely. I'd like to think that I can count on that commitment. You can. You totally can. Even if it's hard. Even if it costs you something. - Yeah? - Yeah, well, you know, real commitment isn't just açai bowls. It's a lot murkier. Would you get into the murk, the muck? For the firm? For me? For your co-workers. Would you back them, all the way? I'm sorry, are we talking a hypothetical or something specific? I mean, you know I'd kill myself for the job. That I'll do anything that's expected. Mm. But if you need me to do something... beyond the scope of trading or whatever, well... Don't sweat it, Mafee. We're all good. Enjoy your wholesome and healthy snack. A while back... you told me I no longer had a feel for all the personalities in here. I'm sure when you first started the place you knew - everyone's spouse's name. - Yeah. And what sports the guys played in high school. There's no way you can anymore. The place is too big. And you're long past really caring. If you ever did. That's true. - But you... - Yes. I "care." I can see that. Especially for some of them. Like Mafee. You and he seem to have a special bond. He brought me in, and supported my vision before even you did. Well, he recognized it. I kind of took it from there. You did. But. Mafee? I need to understand what motivates him, beyond the money and the trappings. The idea that he's serving something greater than himself is what drives him. But... he has an old fashioned sense of honor, chivalry almost... not in any paternalistic sense of the word. He took the fall with his frat for a hazing incident even though he wasn't part of it. Anyway, he'd skirt the line if he couldn't see the harm in it, especially if it benefited the organization as a whole, but he'd never do something truly against his sense of wrong and right. Something that would cause him dishonor. I see. Do you think he'd consider lying dishonorable by its nature? It would depend on the situation. He might lie to protect a friend. Or someone he loved. But that's it. Uh-huh. Is there something I can help with? Something I can do... No.

TAYLOR AND MAFFEE TALKING AFTER AXE ASKED MAFFEE IF HE'D COMMIT FOR HIM, THEN ASKED TAYLOR WHAT DRIVES MAFFEE This is like a country song where the guy drowns his sorrows in whiskey only you're using powdered chocolate. Growing up in Aurora, for pocket money I used to shovel driveways. Money was good. Best part was the hot chocolate. Sometimes, it's still the only thing that works. I thought you were watching it, eating clean. I was. Trying. What drove you to it this time? Just a feeling. I guess I was thinking about how much this job has given me. Like how I don't have to worry about pocket money. Well, you have given to the job also. Yeah. And I'm proud of that. Couple times a year I go home and see the guys. This one's got a weed shop, this one's still doing driveways during the winter... with a plow truck now, but a shitty one. This one needs a loan. Shit, they all do. Which you give them? I do. Because I can. Sometimes the guys make jokes about how I earned it. That at least weed is legal out there. That what I do is even worse. But I've always laughed along because I know I'm not one of the bad ones. That they're not gonna hear about me on the news. That my reputation is good. You know? Yes. I do. The Feds interviewed me last week. So, in the matter of the Ice Juice short that you booked, we will need you to stip to Wendy Rhoades calling in the order. This is the part where you talk. My client prefers not to answer. I bet he does. We will subpoena you to testify in court. My client will not lie under oath. I'm not a liar. There you have it. <i>My lawyer said I shouldn't talk to anyone about it...</i> but I just don't know if I should dive on a live grenade for this place or not. Would you? It would depend on the reason and the circumstances. Without knowing the specifics, and I'm not asking you to tell me, I cannot give you a complete answer. But I can say this: The kid you were, the one who went out with a shovel on freezing days while everyone else slept in, that kid earned his way here. And will earn his way in this business whether Axe Cap exists or not. You really think so? The individual sacrificing themself for the whole can be the most beautiful thing there is. But not if it's done under duress or for the wrong reasons.

WENDY SUGEGSTING SHE MANIPULATES MAFFEE TO AXE AND OTHERS IN MEETING ROOM <i>I don't understand why you didn't just</i> put a number in front of Mafee. I felt like trying to buy him wouldn't work. Make him feel dirty somehow. - And that's a bad thing? - To him. Yeah. I think. Then we threaten to fire his ass. I'd be careful there, Wags. You would. You're a lawyer. But I'm a ruffian. I say we let him know: it's not just Axe Capital, but it's every shop on the Street. You'll be dead man walking. Might actually harden his stance. Well, we gotta solve this somehow... He papered the trade. The Feds will be questioning him. If they haven't already. And once he goes on the record, we're gonna be wrapped up in a straitjacket on this thing. His unwillingness to lie... his sense of honor... his great, big, sweet heart. All these things that seem like impediments. We can use them. <i>I</i> can use them. How? He likes me. We all like you. No. He<i> likes</i> me. - Ahh. - Ahh. - That tracks. - It could work. Oldest trick in the book. Go to it.

TAYLOR CONFRONTING WENDY AFETR SHE ESTIMATES THEY MIGHT TAKE ON MAFFEE POST OBSERVING THE MEETINGS AND AXE ASKING HER ABOUT MAFFEE'S CALLING How do you know it's okay? You could be asking about one of six things. Specify. All of it. How do you know you have the right to give advice, to get into the motherboard and move around the processors. Wouldn't that render it non-functional? It's a visual representation of the idea. I could say I've trained for it. But you're not asking about my skill. No. I'm asking about your authority. How you give yourself permission? Are you asking about me or you? We all do it. With our assumptions and our own biases and egos competing with our desire to do good. But to be frank, I'm asking about you. As in all things, I balance the issues in question, remember my oath, proceed from there. The doctor's oath. Do no harm. Three words. And yet. Almost impossible to put into practice. I need to know what brought this on. Mafee. Axe was asking about him. There are meetings going on. I could see he was in extremis. Why? Don't you know? Why would I? I assumed he'd talk to you. Which made me feel good. It did? Yes. Because I knew, or felt I knew, that you would only give him the wisest counsel. That which would be in his best interests, both professionally and personally. As you always do for me... Yes. Yes, of course. But he hasn't come to me. I wonder why that is? I'm sure he has his reasons. But should he come to me, that is exactly what I'll do. Good. That's what I expect you to do. The right thing.

I love<i> owning</i> the Flemish school, but it is tough to hang in a PoMo townhouse. My wife says the Dutch Masters don't go with the De Sede couch. She's young. She is indeed... Look, Bobby, now that we're together, let me congratulate you in person. I hope you got the bottle of Armand De Brignac. I did. Thanks. I always knew you were falsely charged. I hope you know I was doing everything I could from the inside. Of course. I felt you. Score one for the good guys. Yeah. Well. - Hmm. - So, get to it. Well, you know I'm committed to my government post. The sense of service. The good I'm doing for the country as the Secretary of the Treasury... We're all sleeping a lot better knowing you're watching over the markets... But, I do like to keep an eye peeled for opportunities. In this case? Natural gas. You know regulation has been strangling the sector. You know something different? I know many, many things thanks to my proximity to the FERC. But what I need is someone who can act on the information. Todd, I would never trade on privileged, non-public information. And I hope whatever audio or video recording devices running in here right now have me saying that loud and clear. You've got it wrong. Do I? Look, I just got out of the government's fucking web. I'm not walking back into it thanks to you. I knew you'd be reluctant to trust me. That you would need some sort of proof of my intent. Security Bank of Grand Cayman. This is the bank... one of them... where I still have my offshore accounts. DC doesn't know about it, of course. Nor do they know that I'm telling you that the EPA is about to rescind a certain regulation that will prop up the entire natural gas space. Hmm? I'll give you the details. Take the account information and give me my piece in crypto. I'll see you soon, Bobby.

BOBBY BUYING TAYLOR THE RANGE ROVER For you. You'll look good in it up in Hudson on weekends. It's not for sale. Oh, everything's for sale. - I'm not that easy to buy off. - I'm not trying to. I just thought you could use a little love. You did a lot of good work under tough conditions. This is not about ego. It's about acting rationally. Logically. Like my quant project, for instance. I'd really like to keep them on until... Broom them, like I told you. You cleared the entirety of our positions... our successful, money-making positions... right before asking people to trust you with outside money. Won't that look like erratic behavior? No, it'll look like we're putting our best foot forward. And you're getting paid, so you shouldn't worry about it. Forget the car. I want my own book. A billion dollars. To manage, unencumbered. You took your ball back. Give me something of my own. Fine. Done... So you don't want the car? Let's go. No. I'll take that, too.

Lara. - Hey. What's up, Gord? - Hi, Dad. I'm taking him to the dentist, but I had to come by to straighten something out. Oh? What's that? This 2 and 20 fee charge has got to be some sort of clerical error, Bobby. No error. It's no longer my money. The fees go to Axe Cap's hard-working employees who ensure your returns. Seriously? If I'm paying retail I may as well yank it out and spread it around... Calm down. Gord, hang here a sec. Lara, with me... Look, you can move your money if you want. But if you want me to manage it, this is the cost. Didn't you read the agreement? Didn't<i> Birch</i> read it? Gordie! Hi, Aunt Wendy. Hey. What's going on? Mom and Dad are having a smackdown. Smackdown? What Mom calls a fight. Hmm. Sit, sweetie. After all the nice talk, this is the truth of it: you're pissed and you're being vindictive, that I got half your money. I may be vindictive, but it's not over that. You threatened to take my kids across the country while I rotted in jail... I was trying to look out for them. This is something we don't come back from. Instead of focusing on what fees you're paying, I suggest you focus on the money you're making. How you'll spend it. What your life will be like going forward. Because that's what I'm doing. So they say to us: it's not your fault, it's something that happened between Mommy and Daddy. - That's right. - I know. But Dean and I didn't even think it was our fault... until they started saying that... Hmm. The thing you need to understand is: you are not your parents. - You are... - Who the hell gave you permission to talk to my son. Gordie! Wait outside. You should listen to your mother. Go, sweetie. Thanks, Aunt Wendy. Don't call her that. She is not family! The men in my life don't need any more of your fucking advice. I think you might be in a place where you can't even recognize when someone is trying to help. No. I can recognize your intention. But when I look at Bobby, it's the results that seem all fucked up to me.

You told me to clear the positions. I didn't just clear twenty-five percent of them. You told me to broom the quants. I didn't just get rid of a quarter of them. I told you you'd get the billion. I didn't tell you when. You are CIO. It's an advisory role. So some oversight is necessary. You're going to oversee my investments? Call them suggestions. And I'd like yours on buying a basket of natural gas names and pipeline companies. Then my suggestion is: don't. Regulations are too unpredictable and are hampering the industry. What do you know about upcoming announcements that might mitigate that? I don't know anything. Because I don't work in the government. But you know something. About a coming ruling. From inside? Why don't you make the play, jumpstart your new book. Keep it. I'll come up with my own. Suit yourself. You can lead a horse to natural gas but you can't make it invest. I question why you're making this kind of move. Not based on analysis, but rather on unsubstantiated information. Is it because of the raise? Wanting to look prescient? It's about the future of Axe Capital, making it what it's supposed to be. What's that? Unassailable. Untouchable. Unbreakable. An institution that's TBTF-W... too big to fuck with. Do you know how you sound? Yeah. Certain.

I figured it'd last... The feeling of exhilaration? Of winning. Last longer than a day. Did you even get a full day? The initial jolt when it all worked out and the judge gaveled it... that was pretty good. Felt like I was doing 220 miles an hour on a dirt bike in Moab and skidded to a stop just before the cliff. But then it ended and there was nothing. So no. You know, I thought that a battle of the kind that we just fought could truly be won. I beat the case. I'm back here trading. I'll be around for my boys... - We need to talk about Gordie... - We do. There's residual damage. He's part of it. Can that ever be undone? No. We're all scarred. Yeah. I thought scar tissue was supposed to be stronger. That's actually medically untrue, it's just rougher. Well, I liked it better the other way. Yeah. Well. Sure. Me too. Then what do you got for me? I can't help but feel that whatever advice I offer you, or Chuck for that matter, now, is colored by what we've all been through and done. It's less pure. As am I. Because of Mafee? For one. I set him up really good. Got his loyalty going for as long as I needed it. Look, give yourself a pass on that. It barely registers as bad, the world I come from. I'm not sure I can. Okay. Let me give you some advice for a change. Maybe I'll take it too: you can sit here killing yourself if you want, but when you do something to put yourself back in charge, remind yourself that you are not less, but more powerful for what you've come through... that's when you'll feel better.

What the fuck is he doing here? We busted a cap in his ass, we didn't just give him the day off. I know, I know. And I can't believe I'm fucking doing this, but I may have been a bit hasty in the personal insult and car wrecking departments... Ya think, Rickles? You called him a pants shitter on the trading floor. Explain. I have to tell you that Spyros here has... shared a unique... investment strategy with me. One that is proprietary. Based on his prior... work experience. Are you understanding this gibberish? Yeah, I may be. And this... strategy, you believe it'll pay off? I do. If we carefully implement it, it can remove certain... doubt, endemic to the market. Is this a renewable source? As long as we don't 'open our proverbial overcoats' and 'flash our junk' at a particular three-lettered agency. As long as we play it cool. Right. Alright, Spyros. You may have provided additional value. I'm gonna give you a second shot at Wilbury status. "Handle me with care." Pound it out. No. Still not a fucking Wilbury. Not even close.

Kids are being driven to the restaurant. Good, I'll be leaving shortly when I finish up here. So...? I've thought about it, and, uh, I'm ready to give you a discount on the fees. Discount? If you sign an agreement... a seven year lock up. - On the money. - Mm-hmm. 1.5 and 15. It's not the discount you wanted... which, by the way, I give to nobody. But it's the best discount I give to anybody. Oh. I'm so moved, Bobby. Oh, and one more thing: uh, the boys. They're not going anywhere 'til college. So a seven year lock up on our kids, too? Mm. Fine. I'll do it... For one and ten. Deal. But you got to sign it right now. In front of me. Terms already drawn up, huh? I figured where we'd end up. I'm sorry you had to see that. I'm gonna need you to do something else for me...

You seeing this? "Gas stocks pop on EPA lift of regs"! This play is gonna be a wave we ride all the way to the beach. When we sell our position, we got to cut Krakow his piece. Big day... especially in the natural gas space. I guess your "hunch" came in. It happens... And you know what? Even though you didn't back my play, I'm gonna release another 100 million to you. Thanks, I guess. You heading out for the night? Soon. After I finish up a few things. You? Same here... I'm out. You coming? Not quite yet. You know when I get on the treadmill at the gym, I got to stay on until the guy next to me gets off. Go further, longer. It's just the way I'm wired. You go to a gym with other people in it? There was a time. <i>I'm not gonna make dinner.</i> <i>Buy the kids every dessert in the place</i> <i>and take them home.</i> Sure. Not a problem. That was your dad, uh... he got hung up at the office.

Once I lived in a palace. Right in Khamovniki district. I admire any man who earns a castle. But it<i> is harder</i> to keep one. I should have met you then, when your words might have helped. Instead of fortifying myself, I swam in my pool... Olympic sized. Every day. I'm not such a good swimmer no more. Tell him why. I used to ship barrels of oil for Grigor Andolov. No one shipped faster or skimmed less. Then Grigor got out of jail. He done some reading in jail, he said. And now what he wanted was as old as Marx himself, seize means of production<i> and shipping.</i> He might've misunderstood that part. He understood everything. Believe me. He offered to buy me out... for nothing. You said no. If I'd said no, I'd be dead. I said yes. But too slowly. Also I ran too slowly. Cost you the wing. He took my business. And now, instead of Olympic pool... Ah, selling hot dogs is a classic New York trade. I have coffee cart. On a shit corner. I<i> dream to afford</i> a hot dog cart one day. Your dream just came true. Dream bigger next time. <i>Grigor Andolov presents rare problems.</i> He's a sovereign nation. Insulated and protected in a way that makes him impossible to counter. Also, ruthless. Yeah. I got that from the part about the guy getting his arm ripped off. And now you know the risks. And it's your choice. As in all things. But just so you hear it directly: if you take his money, I may not be able to cover you. - You could have come in. - No, thanks. This is already too close for my comfort. How'd it go? - I'm conflicted. - Good. You know I need to relaunch. You're looking for an icebreaker... first money in. Gets the party started. Entices other investors, all that. But. Grigor Andolov is as liquid as they come. Doesn't answer to anyone. Does what he fucking pleases... That's the part that has me... Hiding in the car? Waiting. Waiting in the car, Big Kahuna. What did Hall say? Oh. That he's got this, no problem. - Oh, boy... - Yeah. Let's pass for now. Set me up with your guy at Spartan-Ives.

Gentlemen, what goods or services can I and Spartan-Ives provide? For years, as our prime, you've touted your connections and offered capital introductions. And we've accepted and said thanks, but really... We didn't need you to generate those leads. And so now is your moment to shine like a pasty on the nipple of Lili St. Cyr in the bright lights of the Florentine Gardens. You want us to provide cap intro. Got it. Absolutely. What range were you thinking? Twenty billion. And the timing? How soon do you want the money? Oh. The year 2112. We'll do the raise as a celebration of Rush's 2nd best album. That's why we got you in here today. You mean<i> Moving Pictures</i> is number one. But I think it goes <i>Hemispheres</i> then<i> A Farewell To Kings</i> then<i> 2112 then Pictures.</i> Well, you would. But the point is: I want the fucking money now. Look, you want an unprecedented raise in record time. And first money post-indictment precludes institutional investors... So how are you going to help me get the first ten stacks? You do a full rehab tour. Next idea. Sell a piece of the fund. That's for people who believe they've already top ticked and are looking to cash in. I haven't. Look, you got to give me a little bit of time. I mean, I'll generate ideas. I promise. How's this? Generate some money. Then you can pay someone for an idea. We need momentum. Lift. We need the icebreaker<i> now.</i> We need Grigor Andolov. Fuck. Guy is a Siberian brown bear. He'd as soon rip our faces off as give us his money. Don't go full Grizzly Man. Treadwell was reckless. Forgot he was dealing with a wild animal. Thought they were friends. I won't... When I was trading only my own money because the government had me handcuffed, that was one thing... it was a necessity. Still doing it now, when the cuffs are off... It's admitting irrelevance. And I will not do that. Fucking ever. Nice hit. I'm deciding whether or not to buy this team. They let me play. They're good boys. My skills are not like theirs but I make up for it with aggression. In my experience, that quality makes all the difference. In school, in bars, in the market, in prison... I was in. Now I'm out. I don't think about it. Unless it's brought up. Ah. If you say so. I don't think about my fight with my government either. If<i> you say so.</i> Look at us, couple of tough guys. World beaters. Yet, investors will have questions. How will you explain your troubles? Victim of class warfare. I win too much, game must be rigged. I have heard it said that every life is like a body of water with the equal amount of salt added. The key to enduring it, is to expand your body, to make your body so vast inside... that you don't even notice the salt. I say, who the fuck has time for that? I just decided to like the salt. However you get there, right? Survival, in this world, is<i> all.</i> Well, I know that better than anyone else on Wall Street... Look. Why don't you cancel all your other meetings around town with these candy-asses... Maybe I like to hear their strategies, to see what I could steal. Maybe I'm not convinced you've got your edge back. Or maybe I am, and I just want to see you work a little bit harder for it. No one works harder than me. Good. Our lieutenants should meet. Pick through the grains of rice... strategies, numbers. How we make ourselves richer. Stronger. Thick with power, like Vasily Alekseyev himself. Yes? Yes.

Heard you sold the Maserati. I really hope you're not having me followed again. No. I heard from the car guy. Without the drive to Westport, it didn't make sense. You can't ferry the kids in it. You can't open it up on Henry Street. I hope you're not insulted. No. I don't give a fuck what you do with your things. But it was a great car. I thought you deserved a great car is all. Mr. Andolov doesn't test waters, he parts them. That's what I wanted to hear. Because I propose to use this money to launch an entirely new strategy: Axe Cap's first foray into impact investing. Socially conscious ownership. You mean you would be leaving so-called vice investments out of the portfolio. No alcohol, no tobacco... That's the version you read about at Harvard. But the current wave, which we would better, isn't zero negative impact. It's<i> positive impact.</i> ESG. Environmental, social, and government investments. You pitched enviro to a fucking oil oligarch? You told me to take the meeting. I pitched the strategy I thought best. You tanked the meeting. You pitched an idea you knew they would find repulsive. You don't want Grigor Andolov's money on board. Yes. You're right. I think international criminals are unstable bedrock for a cap raise. You don't think taking his money was at least worth a discussion? There was a discussion. I see.

What do you do when Axe is wrong? He's never wrong. - But what about when... - Never wrong. But what about when he is? Let's take this conversation off-campus. So, is that some piss running down your leg? I know you didn't like the strategy we pitched your guy. Pitching potato-powered cars and all that... fucking with my lieutenant. With me. Not so. Then you're scared. You don't want to do business with me. I wouldn't have invited you here if that were the case. You don't want to insult me personally. So you invite me over for the 'save meeting' in the hopes that I will end the conversation myself. So. Now. Answer: Is that some piss running down your leg? Fear isn't in this. In me. - I think you see that. - Why do you say that? Because you invite me over to the house where your children sleep? And this makes you tall and tough and proud? I'm a fucking businessman. And a real sweetheart. I'm Casper the Friendly Ghost. Yeah. So am I. And if you mention my kids like that again you'll find out just how fucking friendly. That was fun! And exciting. You know, I heard a story about an oligarch... maybe you know him, maybe you can tell me if it's true. He liked to hunt. But his idea of hunting was to hunker down in a heated cabin. He had people do the real work. They tracked the game, corralled it, gored it, and led it to a well lit area. And our guy, from the safety of his toasty perch, slid open the glass, took aim with his sniper rifle, and delivered the kill shot. Now, I know men who would say that's not sporting, and others who would say 'however you get there, right?' I would say it wasn't me. Wasn't real Russian either. Why go through the charade? If you want to kill the meat, kill the meat. If you only want to eat the meat, get someone else to do the killing. Makes sense to me. But I do my own. And I'm not afraid of the wet work either. In fact, I'll be your personal craft butcher. I respect this. So, now that you know I want your money, are you coming on board or not? I didn't survive my cell, and get<i> here,</i> to catch a hunter's bullet meant for you. Well, I guess we know now whose pants are soaking. No one's shooting at me anymore. And as for the government, I am hooked up on high. How high? Oh. You want a show of trust? I can do that. I can compel trust. I want a show of influence. So I'll do that thing, too.

What do you see? A needlessly large, uncomfortably garish Greek Revival. Nope. A monument to how <i>never wrong Axe is.</i> This is my house. I'm still paying for it. But I do not live in it. Before I married the mistress of the manor, Axe told me not to go through with it. Who actually does that? Who has the foresight, the confidence, the sheer loyalty to say: she sucks. And you thought he was wrong. I liked the way she danced. Not in some club, with a DJ. But all the time. Like, in a store, or in a restaurant, waiting for a table. Suddenly, she'd be bopping along. I'd sneak out my phone and film her, then I'd send it to my friends, so they could see just how special she was. When she'd turn around and catch me, she had a flash of rage. Turned me on in a way that is hard to describe. Sometimes, I'd take her right in the bathroom. Couldn't even wait. What I didn't know, but Axe did, is that the dancing ends. And the flash of rage turns into long, endless nights of it. I see. You think Axe is wrong because you don't understand his moves. And you don't understand them because they're emotional. And he's emotional because he's fighting for his life. That's what this raise is. The fact that you can't fully understand that doesn't mean he's wrong. It just means you haven't gone beyond your own limits.

I am having a hard time seeing what you are seeing. Perhaps there are real forms behind the shadows on the cave wall... But you can't take that on blind faith. It's not that I haven't seen you turn common metals into gold. But until I understand the process... You can't take it on blind faith. I am bad with ignoring data... and with blind faith. I get it. If it helps, Dylan said it first and best: "he not busy being born"... - "Is busy dying." - Yeah. So I'm choosing the former. Are you sure that's what this is? I'm not ignoring the downside. But I can't let it override my need. Axe Capital's need. I've just learned that if I can see the downside, I can avoid it. My eyes are wide open, both the ones I got in my head and the ones I'm paying you for. Yes. So prepare to present to Grigor's guy a strategy that is not an environmentally friendly "fuck you." And keep those eyes open. Big pearls. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it was Beluga. How can it be Beluga when Beluga is illegal in this country? Of course. Next time, I'll fly in some pangolin. I've arranged for my own exotic delicacy tonight, as well. You do recognize the Secretary of the Treasury? We've toasted. So what? I've raised glasses with movie stars, presidents, nuclear physicists. Doesn't mean we're all on our way to the same orgy. Sometimes, sure. But how can I know? Agreed. A toast does not mean that... Sorry if you're disappointed that I wasn't satisfied with your parlor trick. Do I look disappointed? Come on. I understand you two were previously acquainted. From the party on your boat, in St. Barth's. Well, the boat that follows the first boat. You should know better than to go on a Russian's boat. Grigor showed me where the cameras were, and then he turned them off. But at present, even though we have enjoyed that time together, I've been unable to reach you still. Exactly at the moment where you might have been able to provide me with some extremely useful information. I could lie to you and tell you I didn't get the message, but the truth is: it's by design. I can't "interact" now. I have to fly above reproach, like one of those American Gladiator people on the SkyTrack. Your so-called gladiators would be slaughtered by a third grade choir back home. That's probably true. But I still can't connect with you. Yet here you are. Axe called. Oh. So he still has your number. \_ I would like your number now, Mr. Secretary. Don't put him in a position to have to refuse you or to give in to you. He can't talk to you. It would compromise him. It's not a great time to be backchanneling with the Russians right now. You'd own him. He'd lose the gig. You'd have nothing. So you go through me. Or don't go at all. So, this is the moment you lead with your chest finally? And in front of another man. Then fuck you. No, fuck you. Like Todd said: he is my brother. Were you my brother, I would protect you in the same way. If that doesn't work, I don't want your fucking money. Draw up the papers. I will come in tomorrow to sign.

Did it work? What? Sean Ayles told me you gave him a check for 250K for the Foundation. Right on the heels of selling your Maserati. So did it work? Did it make you feel better? Or less guilty anyway? Not Maserati better... I felt guilty once. About 16, 17 years back I thought: I should be understated, keep a low profile for my investors' sake. And what's so bad about First Class air travel? So, I'm sitting on the runway one night, waiting endlessly to take off. And an hour later, a blizzard closes the airport down. I blend right in with everybody else as we De-planed, tried to book motel rooms for the night. Bought my first Gulfstream the next day. Last time I let guilt win.

No conference room, no lawyers? I could get used to this. I had lawyer read, I don't have lawyer enforce. One rule before we go forward: you can't lose my money. No. Of course not. My every move is geared to make and not lose money... Mnh. No. You can't lose my money... If you do, we have problem. Understood? And so our adventure begins. True, very true... Happy occasion like this reminds me of funny story. Many years ago, I was walking along the Moskva Christmas market. You ever seen Moskva Christmas market? Always a sense of good cheer, even during the lean years. I think it was the wine. They serve warm wine with the spices in it. Cinnamon and... I was waiting on the line... everyone was always waiting on the line. And finally I got my cup, I turn, and there was this little boy. Runny nose. He... he's looking at me so desirous of my cup of this warm, warm wine that I give him a sip. He stares at me with such a gratitude. And then I notice his mother. Plump breasts... she must have known someone. So I give him my cup of wine. And I take his mother away from the square. Behind the soldiers. And after, I leave her <i>for the soldiers.</i> And I walked back, and this little boy is staring at me with his greedy drunken eyes. Do you know what happened to him? No. I always ask. No one ever knows.

She says you have a real forehand. Do a thing, do it well. Your mother teach you that? The opposite, maybe. Thanks for setting this up. Listen, Axe, I'm pulling capital. All of it? 1.5 billion. Oh, that's almost half the investment. I got a good opportunity. Good for you. A Russian oil venture. What you would call a "mortal lock." Your money just landed. I put it in, I take it out. I shake it all about. You know I normally have a quarterly gate for people with new money. But as a courtesy to you I let you come in without that restriction. And I appreciate the courtesy. Now I must take advantage. What'd he say? To let you win next time. I told him that's never gonna happen. You're way too smart to believe that anyway. You got that right. Thanks. It was awesome. Wags, rally the team. We need to step up the timeline on the raise.

Okay, we need to move quickly on the cap raise. The Sex Wax is going on the surfboard as we speak. Getting into the spirit of talking to the primes... I mean to say: we are well positioned. I've been backchanneling with them, and landing that Grigor money lubricates as you said it would... it's telling the story that we are back. - Danger, Will Robinson! - The fuck, Spyros? I couldn't stop him, he said it was DEFCON six urgent. The DEFCON scale only goes to five... Exactly. - And one is the most severe. - Whatever. We just had 1.5 big ones pulled out of the firm. - Oh, shit... - Yeah. That can only be one person... It's Grigor Andolov. And just so you know for the future: you don't have walk-in privileges. Sugarpova? High end! Yumster! You knew? You were going to have us lie in the raise meetings. I thought I had a few more days until the redemption, which meant all the meetings we had wouldn't have been lies. The Street will see the drop in assets under management and read it as one of two things: redemptions or loss. Either way fucks the cap raise. Yeah, so. We lever up big, and quick. Leverage on that scale would have to flow from the institutions. The Street will know we're fucked. Well, you have an alternative? I do. Frotty Anisman. - Gross. - Who? Liquid as hell. He works outside the main of the business. He's a middle man for big money... Middle Eastern money, South American money, dictators, anyone who's got it. Sounds somewhat ideal. You don't know him. That is an unpalatable idea, Wags. Does that mean it's a no? It's an unpalatable idea... Taylor, scour the floor for any quick plays to make up the shortfall. Obscure the reason, but make it clear the timeframe is now. Say it. Carly. Victor. Panay. All the satellite funds. Bring them onboard. Now, that's a fucking good idea... But the one thing more important than giving oxygen to the fire of Axe Cap is keeping my escape hatches open in case those pricks from the government ever come after me again. So, maybe, Raul. Time to call the cops. Bring his fund back to the mothership. Raul, I got a treat for you tonight. This is the ramen that blew Osakisan's mind in Tokyo. - Enjoy. - Thanks, Ivan. This is for you. It's your piece of Panay. The PIN is the date you came to Axe Cap. Prosperous day for us both. As they shall continue to be. More so once you've come back. Shit. Come on, we've had some quiet success with Panay. With your hand on the wheel, sure, but my board of directors likes quiet. Your board likes Devin Hester returns and I'm the only one who can take their money a hundred and nine yards to the promised land. You're doing that. Through Panay. Still too soon. Okay, if you're not gonna come back yourself, go to work for me. Firefighters pension fund, Sanitation workers fund, Corrections officers... convince 'em to come onboard Axe Cap. Come on, feed me some red meat, man. You'll get a cut. You putting me out on the street like I used to with my runny nosed junkie CIs. Yeah, that drive in your pocket's gonna give you a lot more motivation than the crumpled twenties and the methadone tabs you used to give them. I'll make some calls. And I won't ask why you're so desperate for this immediate cash infusion...

I thought we were making progress. When I'd heard you'd stood up to Dollar Bill. Me too! But it didn't last. I think the snap back made me even more timid, somehow. What happened today? You know we're looking for short term cash generators. <i>I have one.</i> I'd like to talk, um, to you later. I have, maybe, I might have an idea to generate alpha, quickly. Go! Here? This is where it all happens. Let fly. Now. I've... uh... been tracking rental car companies for years. Is this an automotive play? Because we're well covered in that space. It isn't. But there's a kernel of an idea that's grown... And? <i>But I couldn't pitch it.</i> And then, I couldn't even... go... Go? It's hard to concentrate with all of you watching right now. <i>Pee. I had pee fright.</i> Come on. Let's walk. We do assessments of everyone who works here. To see who might be a candidate for one of these offices. The C-suite offices? That's right. Most of the time it just confirms that most folks are exactly where they should be. They've topped out. Or worse, are going to bottom out. Is that what mine says? Would I have brought you up here if you were bottoming out? No...? Well, actually, I might. If I thought you needed a jolt. But this is not that. This is: right now, at this moment, if you want to finally live the fuck up to your potential instead of spiraling, you must find a way to shift the paradigm. That could be your office, or that. CIO, picking the strategies. COO, managing the risk. Eh... Maybe even... Owner? Yes, instead of being down there, with them. But that's where I'm comfortable. No. It's where you've made yourself fit. Because you're so bound up in being the smallest, most helpful, unobtrusive version of yourself. Just like your mother shits on your head for. Now, what you need to do to prove her wrong, and prove it to yourself, is something totally out of character, big and bold. Something public, that terrifies you, in order to free yourself. Like... recite a sonnet to a crowd. Invite the office to see you skydive. Become a Toastmaster. Something totally out of character. You have to break through the confidence barrier, because then... you'll break through the C-suite barrier, too.

Sorry man, firefighters won't touch you. They sprint into burning buildings but they're afraid of us? It's not fear, Wags, they're still pissed about 9/11. A little bit. What about Sanitation? Too many retired firefighters in that union. It's a no-go. If it's one thing I know about you it's that that wasn't your only idea. You'll move on to the next one and make it work. Not sure the next one's fully formed. That's because you keep looking backwards to the kind of people who used to invest with you. Instead of forward to the sort of folks you can get now. You have to change. That's what I learned on the job. Six percent of the class gets promoted to lieutenant. Other guys, they got a choice. They either accept that they were left behind. Or they claw themselves forward taking shit assignments no one else is willing to take. Hope to edge up from there. Alright. Let's book that unpalatable meeting on City Island.

Ah, shit! So, you ready to go? Okay. Okay. All right. I guess this is what we're doing. It seems to be. All right. We're almost there, huh? Almost closed on the deal of it all. We<i> have</i> a deal. Yes, we do. Alllllmosst. Because I got to thinking about what I am buying. And I realized I'm leaving the most valuable part untapped. And what's that? Your trades. I can make far more money following you than I even will owning you. You won't be owning me. You'll be owning a small piece of my company that I can call back. All the more, sir, all the more. I need total transparency. And you're gonna give it to me because you got nothing else. Gornisht. Bupkis. Nul. I can't do it... I won't do it... Go home. I pass. You need me. You're not getting anywhere without me and my money. Frotty, I got billions of dollars, hundreds of employees, and two kids at home who think I can fly. What the fuck do you have? The only thing you need. More. All the same, get the fuck out. Fine. Fine. You know I love it when you move with the mystery of Yahweh, but what the fuck? I hope you have something because you just threw out the thing we had. I might. I just might.

You know, when it comes to pension fund managers, these groups never give an answer in the room. But they did this time... The answer was no... It was 'heck no.' They didn't like it? Found it offensive, called us unprofessional. So... what the hell was that? I've been tracking rental car usage in business cities, developing relationships with managers there. Based on lots of activity in Milwaukee, I've deduced a big move is going down... Talk more. Managers of the main airport locations have confirmed that there are lots of Dutch passports being presented for car rentals. Holland Inter-Bev's going after Beer National. My sources were able to confirm, by GPS, that all these cars have been going from a Courtyard Marriott seven miles to... Beer National's Milwaukee headquarters. Right. I think there's a merger coming, if not an outright purchase... And Axe Cap will have positions in both companies, ready for the ride up on the announcement. Well fucking done, Ben Kim. Maybe next time, keep your shirt on...

What the fuck?! This is where<i> you</i> would make some kind of reference to a gangster movie betrayal. As in: I went to the barber and ended up on the floor like Joey Gallo. And you were the only one who knew I was getting a haircut. I probably would. Yeah. But Joey Gallo got killed at Umberto's. It was Anastasia who got it at the barber shop. Also: I didn't kill you. You are standing here in my office, not bleeding out on the linoleum. Same difference in our world. What, exactly, did you do? - Breen. - Bobby Axelrod. Now I know I'm in New York. It's like seeing the Empire State Building or something. Well, I'm gonna give you the view the tourists never get. The floor<i> above</i> the deck with the coin operated binocs. Uh, what do I pay for that privilege? No, no, no, the question is: what do I pay? How do I get you to break your letter of intent with Oscar Langstraat? Bought 50 percent of Breen's company, at 200 million, which placed its paper value at 400 total. NASDAQ have already confirmed they are ready to accept our public offering at a valuation of 2.4 billion. That is a billion added to the value of our balance sheets and 800 million in gains this month... It basically solves our problem. You sold out my relationship in order to do it. No, no. You did. That's why you told me he was at your dinner. Congratulations, by the way. You've earned out on your advance and you're way into bonus already. Hey... I'm sorry. No, you're not. What happened? I'm sorry.

My children. You'll notice they don't whine. You've trained them well. Credit these women with that... my wife, my ex, my mother, but no. The kids came out that way. We were lucky. Also, not American, which when it comes to whining, really fucking helps. That it does. But you trained yourself though. I took from you. You didn't make a squeal or spill a tear. Very un-American. Would it have worked? Only to make me never think of you again. And somehow like the<i> man,</i> Teófilo Stevenson, you boxed your way out of the corner and found a way to cover your losses. Well, what were the choices? Exactly as I'd see it. In the end, I decided not to make the oil deal. For you? No. Eh, maybe a little bit. But now I put the money back. Along with a promise to give you a warning before I pull it again. Best I could hope for. I know you must've broken things... people, deals, someone's hopes and dreams... in order to get money back into your firm. But you swallow it, here, now, because this is business and life and who cares what it costs you? Indeed. I tell you... you must always have a three year old in your house, to make you appreciate life... And you must also have your mother close. To keep the line unbroken. There is plenty I would kill for, you know, if we're being honest. And there's no reason not to be. But family, Axe, I would do things for these people that you couldn't imagine. As they have all done for me. Especially her, my dear mama. You're the boy. Aren't you? In your story. Who took the wine from the stranger? If that were true, what would you be saying about my mother? That she did what she had to do to protect her family. And you. And didn't complain. I am fortunate to have her. You are a fortunate man, Grigor. We are both so. And fortunate to have met when we did. Robert. Hi Mom. We either get to the other side and line dance on Jock's grave, or he will dance on ours. I did more than just run your money, I kept us alive. If you stop performing, you will be replaced. There are men undermining our sacred purpose. I want a hard target search of every online footprint. I'm just not sure it's strictly legal. We can do it. Most people pick their spots. Well, I pick every spot. And a win isn't a win unless it's a kill.

\- Hey, Axe. How are you, man? - Hey. I don't think we knew you were coming. Just give us a second, and we're gonna have your table. - Nah. No need, JT. - Okay. Enjoy. Thanks. - Hey, Axe. - Hey, Lizzie. Ah, fuck, Axe. Can't you skip a year? I could. But what fucking fun would that be? I'm Martin Carlisle. Who you are is a witness to this year's edition of Fuck Ups Fucking Up. Today, at Axe Cap, it's comp day. And so, as always, I'm reminded of the best day of my life. The day that this man, Bill McGann of McGann Commodities, told me I didn't have enough Blarney in me. What he meant was: I didn't kiss enough ass. I meant you didn't have a soul. And so, by means of instruction, he wasn't gonna bonus me right. He shorted me by 50,000. Hey, I can leave you two to... Stay. I'm leaving. So, here I am, as I am every year, to thank you. And to buy you breakfast. Just think. If I'd stayed, you maybe could have owned this hotel. Least I can do is get your check. Right before I engage in the very same rumble that left you knifed and bleeding in the schoolyard. You're about the same age I was back then. You've had a good run, kid. But you can't stay clear of the switchblades forever. You're not a Greaser anymore, Axe, you're a Soc now...

What's the mood down there? They've got that lean and hungry look. Like to leave 'em that way. Let the hunger set in. Starvation, in small doses, triggers an increase in energy, clarity, aggression... Right up until it kills you. You gotta feed 'em something. Why? I make the decisions, do all the heavy-lifting, actually earn the money. Mortimer Duke said it best: No getting around the old minimum wage. Actually, that was said <i>to</i> Mortimer Duke, but that's a helluva pull. The thing is: most years, I'm paying with other people's money. Now it's my own money. That reminds me of a prayer I said every night as a kid: "And now I lay me down to sleep, "I pray the Lord my soul to keep, "and if I die before I wake, "I pray that all my toys should break."... So my fucking brother and sister can't play with 'em. Why don't you just delay comp decisions until after the raise? Outside money will be back on board, you'll feel better about the whole thing. Three things in life you can't postpone without dire consequences: calling a doctor when gutshot, finding a toilet when traveling in India, and paying your people. The last two being more or less the same. Listen. Don't think the raise isn't the thing; it's the only thing. Without that money, I'm not bonusing people, I'm putting them out on an ice floe. Okay. Then I just want to make sure you're aware of a promise I made to everyone while you were gone: No one makes less than last year. That's why they stayed. I am aware that that was<i> your</i> promise. Anyone you think deserves more? - No. - Not even Ben Kim? Kid's practically your gimp. I think he's ready to move to PM. I could see that. Then let the promotion be his bonus this year. Too much too fast could overwhelm him. Has it overwhelmed you? Looks like you're up. Let's move over to the desk. - You talk to Lara? - Mnh-mnh. Be bold. Check in with me later. First time in the ring without training in Catskill with Cus. You ready? Yeah. I got my Kevin Rooney. I'll be fine. Fifteen million dollars. You aren't going to start with a performance review or... Helluva year. Fifteen. - I was thinking 50. - How'd you get there? Axe Cap made 929 million this year. When you account for expenses, nets to almost 700. Seeing as how I ran the place for most of that time, less than one-tenth of the profits seems more than fair. Might be. But then again, I was the client. So you're kind of comparing apples to my money. I did more than just run your money. I kept us alive. I killed it at the Idea Dinner. I convinced the Street that night, and every day since, that there was always someone at the helm. I got us through a natural disaster. I all but closed Kansas City before Ben Kim went Thunder From Down Under on them. And let's not forget that I was key in making up the shortfall from Grigor's redemption, at great personal cost. Still sore about Oscar? Yet here I am, still ready to help lock down the raise. About that. No, you're not. I don't actually need you in the pitches. For one thing, you bombed your first raise meeting, with Grigor's lieutenant, bombed it on purpose. And for another: the investors need to know that you're here at Axe Cap, that someone's "always at the helm." Besides... the raise is my thing. I'm thinking that the final number will be something just shy of half of what you're looking for. - I don't agree. - This isn't heavy petting on the Oberlin campus: we don't both have to agree. I say what it is. You take it. Yes, that is so. But still. I don't accept. I never made that much at your age. I've accomplished more than you had. But you don't have your own shop. If you were ready for that, we wouldn't be having this conversation, I'd be looking at a Taylor-shaped hole in the wall. Twenty is as much as anybody's ever gotten out of me. Learn to be rich on that. And I was beginning to think you were done teaching me. Let's finish this later. I'd like half a million. You just got here. Your signing bonus is your comp. I didn't say I deserved half a million. But you rarely get what you don't ask for. So I'm fucking asking. Otherwise, why are we doing this? We've never talked one-on-one. I wanted to get a hit off of you. I hit like the Purple People Eaters. So be careful what you wish for. Oh. This is gonna be fun. I believe I've proved my value. Don't need to justify a thing to you at this point. Oooh, working stiff. Just like your personal totem, The Undertaker. Do you have people feeding you this shit about us ahead of time? Thing is, for the last couple of weeks, I haven't really felt your presence. You saying I've been coasting. I'm saying there's no garbage time at Axe Capital. Every minute of every quarter matters. No scrubs get playing time. And even if you are my MVP at the All-Star break, if you stop performing, you will be replaced. Pay me what you're gonna pay me. Save the pep talks for someone who needs 'em. I think I like that version of you. But I could hate it another time. Ok. What you did with the Wendy thing aside, and it's hard to put it aside, I'm paying you 1.3, a personal record. On top of your other bonus that's more than a two-ball for this year. But that is not a repeatable trick. When we're here 12 months from now, if you're not still bodyslamming like... uh... King Kong Bundy... Did you pretend not to remember that to make me feel good? Goodbye Mafee. I think... I should not throw out the first number, because I have a tendency to undervalue myself. I'd like to make you a PM. Portfolio Manager? I would have gone Prime Minister, but there you go, undervaluing. - And the money...? - Meet the new salary, same as the old salary. I'm a PM.

I really have to watch what I tell you. It's like you're listening to every word. Especially when you start talking about hiding out in bathtubs. And places that remind you of what that felt like. I wasn't hiding. It's just that when I was younger the bathtub was the only place I could go to be alone and think. I'd press myself against the sides so hard eventually my legs would go numb. Then I'd start thinking I didn't have legs, and I'd wish for fins. Because then not fitting in would make more sense. I get it. I almost feel like a mermaid here. Comp didn't go the way you wanted. He said I was off the raise team. Is he punishing me for doing exactly what he asked of me? Axe doesn't punish people. Unless they've wronged him. Or Lara. Or his kids. Or me. Or the New York Football Giants. I won't stagnate. Not for Axe. Not for anybody. You know Axe has never changed a comp decision. So I've heard. And I might be able to live with the number he can live with. But what I need is forward momentum, above all things, even money. Yes. You do. I'll talk to him. Give me a day.

Axe, you remember Ari Spyros. Works down in Compliance. Uh. Rings a bell. But like children of the 1800s, seen and not heard. And not even seen, you know? Spyros was concerned that his comp meeting wasn't on the books. I am sure it's an oversight. Was it an oversight? Compliance does not get performance-related comp. - Oh. - Sure. Usually. But Compliance doesn't usually turn around a shop overnight. But before I got here this place was dirtier than the porta potty outside a third-rate donkey show. Arrests, fines, investigations up the wazoo. And since the Greek Freak has been on the scene... You cannot call yourself that. There is no bonus for Compliance. What about the other stuff? Extracurricular stuff... I'm talking about the stuff in Bill's other garage. Doesn't Ari get to wet his beak? Ohh. I forgot about that... That reminds me of where you were right before you decided to share that little brainstorm. Fired. Halfway out the door. Three quarters. Literally. Dead to me. No, your comp is getting your job back. Getting to hiss and tinker with your little espresso erector set rather than pick through the Dumpster for your mangled steam wand. - I see... - If we were to do a little accounting of how much you meant to Axe Cap, we would first have to look at what you cost me by turning Wendy in. The consequences of your "chaos grenade." Yeah. To say nothing of the nightmare that you plunged her into, and the unthinkable acts I had to perform in order to set things right. I mean dollars and cents alone. The fines, the bonuses, the jet fuel to Nova Scotia, you owe me 1.195 million dollars. You know what? I don't think I need a comp meeting. My... My base is very generous, and I think we should just leave it right there. That was the full Signor Roberto. "The rent stays like before." Yeah. That's the first comp meeting I've actually enjoyed. You know, I'm tempted to fire the whole fucking lot of them. Except maybe like two. But someone has got to roll the coins up into those little sleeves. Yeah. Practically all they do. Nah, you can't fire 'em, estro. Right before the raise, it'll look like panic. Like there's not enough grain to get everyone through the winter. I know. So I'm not doing it... But, you know, when I'm sitting across the table from them and I see their hungry little mouths, they're people, sure, my people, and I love 'em most of the year. But today, all I can see is their snapping fucking mouths, and instead of wanting to feed 'em, I just want to punch their teeth in.

The rest of them are scared to come in when I'm in here. I clocked you going in about 20 minutes ago, I figured this was as close to a Beta state as I'll ever find you in. Mm. What then? You've got personnel problems. That's what they'd all like you to think. None of 'em are going anywhere. I'm talking about one person in particular. Taylor is about to get paid the same as James Harden. - You think they can't get by on that? - It's not about money. They keep demanding more of it. Because you're not giving them what's more important than money. So money is all that's left. Well, I'm about to adopt the official policy of the United States and refuse to negotiate with terrorists. You know that's bullshit, right? Our government negotiates with terrorists all the time. Pays them with pallets full of hundreds. But when they're captured, what breaks them, in places like Gitmo, isn't overt torture, it's a sense of disenfranchisement and purposelessness. That's what I'm sowing? Here's the thing: with someone like Taylor, what they need is forward momentum, above all things, even money. My recommendation: Take them to the raise. I could say yes. Why don't I want to say yes though? Because it's yet another fucking accommodation. I got this rich so I could stop making them. Gates plays dollar poker. Buffett eats a drive in hamburger every day. There's no amount of money that frees you from being a person, from interacting with others. Those guys know that. You know that. It used to be an investment pitch entailed them begging you to take their money. Now you've got to peddle your wares along with everyone else. Like a fucking door to door Electrolux salesman. Giving up trading, taking on Grigor, now paying your people out of your own pocket. It must feel like death by a thousand cuts. Yeah. I'm at 999. And I'm sticking. You chose this person for a reason beyond their mathematical ability. Taking on Taylor as a real partner isn't gonna kill you. It may be the very thing that makes you stronger.

Hey... You're not supposed to get the kids back until tomorrow. They're sleeping. Good. Then fucking talk to me. What are you thinking about comp? C'mon. My money's at stake, too. Yeah. I'm taking care of your money. I'm taking care of everything. You taking care of Taylor, too? Wow. Wendy. Good move, well, she's earning her money. And so is Taylor. Aren't they?

Why can't you give Taylor what they want? Because it's too much. And what they want can't be given. It needs to be taken. And what would you do if they tried to take it? Cut 'em down like I was Connor MacLeod. What does it say that you always have to quote the damn<i> Highlander?</i> That I spent some time watching cable TV alone in high school. And that I have pristine taste in movies, even back then. Or, that you see every single challenge as a life or death contest to see who's gonna lose their head. Well, kind of is from where I stand. You really think I should give Taylor what they want? I think you should convince Taylor that you're partners. I'm kind of surprised that you're taking their side. You and I are on the exact same side. They are on the other. But I want them happy and earning. Well, yeah. Me too. You sure? 'Cause you know how to keep somebody, and how to drive them the fuck away... I know some people bail... We're talking about Taylor. - If you want Taylor gone... - I don't want them gone. So then give them more than what you want, even if it's less than what they want. Quickly. You're right. You're always right about this stuff. I'm right about a ton of stuff. Not just this. Thanks for coming over. Stay. C'mon, Bobby. We're not gonna get sloppy, are we? No, I guess not. I'll pick up the kids tomorrow. Like the lawyers agreed.

Let's settle this. You're a valued part of this place. You've been effective in every meeting you weren't deliberately trying to sabotage. Thank you. And about the 50 million. You can have half that. I've never come up that far, never paid that much. Now, okay, I know it's not exactly what you want. But I've been giving it some thought, and I realize that what you really need is... forward momentum, above all things, even money... So I'm putting you on the raise team. Fuckin' A. Onward and upward. There's gonna be 30 Bil on the table, get ready to help me haul it outta there. Oh, I am ready. Well, you may be the one person here who actually earns her bonus every single day on the job. You saw Lara. Because you did. Thanks for that. And for all of it. Your Ice Juice profits, listed under someone else's account, they've been put back under your name. And I doubled it. So you can take your comp meeting off the books, you just had it.

Normally we go over your legal bill on the phone. To avoid... you know. After today, I don't think I'm gonna be writing any fat checks for a while. Plus, this year's tab, you outdid yourself. Record-setting. I knocked 30 percent off the hours before I even sent it to you. Sure. Of course you did, because you inflated 'em in the first place. Ten million fucking dollars... You're gonna haggle with me, after the victory I delivered? <i>You</i> delivered it? I seem to remember you encouraging me to tuck tail and take a plea. Leaving<i> me</i> to figure out how to work miracles. How much do you want to fucking pay? Not a penny over nine million. You're doing this over a million dollars... - Mm. - A number that doesn't mean jack shit to you, but would mean the world to my firm and the dozen associates who worked all-nighters on your fucking case. And yet you push and push. Most people pick their spots. - Well, I pick every spot. - Of course. You can't just engage, you've got to compete, you can't merely compete, you've got to win, and a win isn't a win unless it's a kill. You want the fucking nine million or not? Fine. Send it. See ya soon.

What's the total? Same as last year. To the raise. Ahh. Next year, when you've got 30 billion under management, you're gonna look back fondly on how little you paid today. Actually I still have one comp meeting left. Is it mine? I bet it's mine. It is. I know it's been a strange year for you, serving different masters, almost losing me... Don't take me back there. But through it all, you have been the bulwark that Axe Cap needs. And so for this, I have a special present. That's more like it. Reach behind the couch. Whoa. Oh, it brings me back to childhood. All the high-end nudity of a cadged<i> Playboy,</i> but with sophistication, and that certain <i>je Ne sais quoi</i> of the French. Oh, and your bonus is the age you were when you first discovered that magazine. Pains me to take from your personal vault... but nine million feels good.

AXE WITH MOM GETTING THE MAGAZINES FOR WAGS Where did you find these? I can't believe you kept all of Dad's crap. Yeah, well, at first I thought he was coming back. And then I was afraid he'd come back. Then when I realized he wasn't... I thought it'd be petty to toss everything. So I didn't want to give him that power. Yeah? So you asserted yourself... by spending 34 years storing and toting all his stuff. Your father was your first great enemy. Yeah, well, if you abandon your kid, that's what you get. Found it. You know, you hated him <i>long</i> before that. The way you used to take the fight to each other. I used to like the way you were such a fighter. I'll admit that I didn't love when you tried to take the fight to me, though. That was a fucking mistake. I maybe should have told you not to talk like that when you were a kid. I think I still would have. Sure. But you also would have had a little voice in the back of your head telling you not to. Do you have that voice? At all? <i>So, come on. Where?</i> Just came across them. Hmm.

You smell that? You smell that? That's money, son... People who have never been near money will say: "I smell money," when entering a casino or showing up at a sales conference. They, of course, can't because they don't know how to recognize the scent. But you? Like a shorthaired pointer on a dabbling duck. And I am telling you, <i>Sef,</i> I smell<i> money.</i> Gentlemen, today's the day! - How much is on the table? - By the close of the event, 30 billion will be earmarked, invested, captured. If we don't walk out of here with at least a third of the available capital... I've teed this whole thing up so that you will. Should I give you "napalm in the morning"... I already got a version... Then "no vice but beggary"? How 'bout Nick Saban? Roll Tide... Roll! That's fucking impressive. I count on it. Where's Taylor? I have a text. They say: "Soon. Organizing some last-minute things." Pitch doesn't work without Taylor. They better make it. I was just asking myself <i>if</i> I would. And you know what? I would!

TAYLOR AND GREGOV MEETINF FOR MASON CAP RAISE Wow. Every day you live this life you learn something about yourself. Delightful! If you're delighted, just imagine how it makes me feel. That's good. You didn't even flinch. Like the titan, Lee Iacocca. That's important. To business then. I read your approach in the materials you sent. What's your market outlook? I could tell you that interest rates have topped out for the near term, that the tax and regulatory climate are favorable, that growth is looking somewhat robust... I could also read your tea leaves or the creases in your palm or divine the future by cleromancy... Cleromancy? Casting bones. But I'm no gypsy. So instead I'll tell you that my anticipation and my reaction to moment by moment changes in market conditions are lightning quick. And cutting edge tech: a quant piece that wasn't even in place during the past year that reflects my already positive results. Sure. But it's all words. And words have very little to do with how I decide things. What then? Internal process. Like your casting bones. But inside. Last question... Why are you leaving Axe? After all, he made you. We can debate that statement some other time. As for your question: the same reason you leave a house that has a furnace leaking carbon monoxide: It's the only way to survive. I like this image. They say you can't taste it or smell it or even know that it's putting you to sleep. But I always think I would: most people are already sleepwalking through their lives. So they don't even notice. How could they, it's only a matter of degree. You crushed it. I'm glad I brokered this meeting. I have to talk to him, but I imagine money will be flowing shortly.

Only Ricky Roma gets to show up late. Well, I am at the top of the board. What the fuck? Uber... If you're gonna go around, go like a rich person. Take a chopper. I'm here now. Let's do this thing. Remember: they are not buying your proprietary trading platform, they are not buying your strategies, they are buying you. Remind them that we have the answers. That they are safe in your loving arms. Like Barry White. Oh, he'd have had them hands in the air, weeping and singing along. So, yes, exactly like Barry White. There are only two things these allocators really want to know, but they'll never directly ask: Can we be trusted? And are we special? We nail those. We nail this entire thing. Welcome, everybody. Welcome. Thanks for coming. Now, you've read all our stuff. You know my Sortino ratio proves that we get a higher rate of return with less downside vol. How we avoided the XIV liquidation by selling our VIX positions two weeks before everybody else did. And you know who made sure we did that? Taylor Mason! Over the past year, we've seen the lowest market correlation of any fund in the business. You will, of course, want to know why and how. So come sit in and shadow me for a day, because it's like asking a magician how they do their tricks. We all know it's not magic. It's the opposite of magic. It's grinding, focused work, it's sitting on their bed for weeks, months at a time, working slip cuts, perfecting the Elmsley Count... so that the audience never sees where the cards really are. No. It's not magic. But when the effect is presented, it sure feels like a miracle. And if you invest with us, you will be behind the curtain with Axe. And me. All the mysteries revealed. Nothing kept secret from you. Nothing held back. Fully transparent work. I could go on but... But there are bars in New York City some of you want to hit before they close tonight. Look, Taylor is the single most effective manager of money I have ever come across. They are the future of Axe Capital. And I'm just thrilled that you're all gonna get the opportunity to work with them directly alongside me and the team. I've got him. Dramatic. Who you got? Beer tonight?

\- Hair of the dog? - No. It was, indeed, some party last night. But I fear it might be over. Meaning? I've been making follow up calls to book the money that was pledged at the race. I'm having problems locking it in. What fucking problems? Problems reaching people. They're dodging. I'm feeling like somebody slipped us a Cosby. Where the fuck is Taylor? They're here before me most of the time. Not sure. Sent a text this morning, didn't hear back. Huh... ♪ <i>I feel I've been abandoned</i> ♪ ♪ <i>Never got to say goodbye to you</i> ♪ ♪ <i>Give my best to the Entitlement Crew</i> ♪ And no Mafee today. I figured it was the whiskey flu. Fuck. <i>A new kind of organization.</i> Top down but not imperious or impetuous. Integrated. And you can make more than you do now. With a partnership stake. Goddamnit... When? Now. Taylor's making a move. They've played the Elmsley Count on us. So we wouldn't see their real cards. Fuck. Pretended to be one of us... For just long enough to take our personnel and our capital. All of it. Wendy. Now. Tell me she's fucking here. She is. I saw her. Is there anything I can do to stop Taylor from officially opening? You could file, and we will, for intellectual property theft, for tortious interference for both the investor piece and any employees they enticed away, and these suits will have to be defended, but... But we won't win. We won't win fast enough to injunct them from opening. File anyway. Let's get Taylor distracted from the bottom line. Let's see how they do with split focus. Now, who's actually gone? And who's on the fence? So far, it appears that other than Mafee, only Ben Kim sleeps with the fishes. As for the cash: 500 million came onboard, three and a half billion went with Taylor, the other two billion pulled back, went elsewhere... Didn't want to be involved in a family fight. I'm gonna quarantine a few traders I have my doubts about before this thing spreads like black death. Ben Kim is here. He just got off the elevator and went to his station. The important thing is: I said no. So you're not a spy? 'Cause you showed up late on this particular day. So you can see how I'd wonder. I can. But I'm not. I said no. Walk us through how Taylor approached you. Where did you come from? Wrong question. Where are we going is the right one. Is it? Come work for me. I already do. At Mase Cap. You're leaving. Left. But Axe has been loyal... He promoted me. In title, yes, after I told him to. But what kind of money bump did he give you? He gave you a paper title as a way to keep you running in place. But I will give you an entire field to sprint down. <i>Ben.</i> Ben, I'm sorry to have to tell you, but... Oh, no... Taylor told you not to give me the raise. So that I would be dissatisfied and go with them. That's pretty sound from a game theory perspective. Yeah. Well. This ain't no game. But Taylor treated it like it was, and you fell for it... I don't mean that. No. I was suckered. And now I will have my turn. So now that we know why you didn't give me more money, do I get the... Finish that sentence at your own peril, Ben Kim. Though you do have a future here. And one that'll have you getting as rich as a feudal lord if you keep performing. Are you in? I am. Fuck. At a time like this, I suggest looking within. To see what you... what we... may have done to cause this. We rebuild our business as we rebuild our selves. Or, don't look inside. Do what I do instead. Go drinks, dinners, parties, funny massage joints with every fucking whale in the Street and poison that bitch's name to them. For starters.

Grigor. We must meet. Now. Nice place. Yeah. Once I own every townhouse on the block, I'll put them all together. Make a real<i> home,</i> you know? Quilts on the beds, needlepoints on the walls, healing crystals in every window. Until then, this one is a place for special conversations. They can hear it? They hear everything, but they know exactly what happens when someone speaks out of turn. As, I imagine, your man does. I do. So, you know you have a problem, yes? Yes. Because you don't have pest control. So the pests are running all around the place with no consequences. But I'm very good at dealing with pests, with vermin. I have a perfect score with Consumer Reports. So if I promise you that I will make your problem disappear, your problem will never, ever return. I can't allow Mr. Axelrod... Shut the fuck up! I understand what you're offering. But I cannot ask you to do it, at this time. If it were me and I were standing as naked as Paris Hilton and twice as fucked, I would not hesitate. I know you wouldn't. And that perhaps it's what's called for. So, then, you want me to do it? You have to say it. I have to hear you. Why are you willing to do this for me? Look at this from my particular set of binoculars. I gave you my assets. At least in part because Taylor was going to help manage them. So when they fucked you over. They fucked me over, too. But I ask your permission because, really, she is your property. Not mine. Well, I'm grateful for your loyalty. My loyalties are clear. Can I respond by tomorrow? Sure. Shame about Taylor. So smart. Loss for everyone. You seemed to take that seriously. Damn right. When I've suggested such actions in the past, you never even considered it. Well, once a guy like that puts it on the table, you have to think about what happens if you say no as much as if you say yes. If you decide on something this final, it shouldn't be farmed out, it should be done in-house. Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. Look, I need to think about what other options I have. And how to protect myself no matter which choice I make. And I need to look Taylor in the eye. Shit, Axe, look, it was time for a change. I'm sure you thought so too. I want to thank you, of course. Figured I would when the dust settled... Shut the fuck up, Mafee. You did what you did, you got your money, but no amount I give to charity will help me atone for the ass fucking I will give you in this business. You hearing me? Now go get your new fucking master. The palace coup is complete. Today you settled all family business. I get that you're angry. But I think it's because I left before you could finish me off. You think I was acting against you? The undercutting, the manipulation, and public, and private, humiliation. The lies and broken promises. All while I good soldiered it and made you money. But how long, really, was it going to be before you sent me off to slaughter? Wrong. I wasn't getting rid of you or working against you. You were on the inside. We were succeeding together. I trusted you in a way that I almost never trust anyone. It may have seemed unorthodox, but that's the truth of it. And now you've taken from me. You've stolen from me, under false pretenses. And you've betrayed me. I did what I had to do to survive. And to win. You've got to understand that. I did it for me, not against you. Sure. Right. Congratulations, now you have your own shop, billions under management. You're moving even quicker than I did. Yes. I'll surpass your assets under management, at the rate I calculate, in three years at the earliest, eight at the latest. Maybe. You're ready for the summit. But you know what they call that spot up on Everest? The Death Zone. Some people that make it up, and then they make it back home. But there are countless more, fucking dead, encased in ice for all time. That's where you are now. And very few people can even survive on the available oxygen up here. Even fewer can perform. So we'll see. Young lungs. So yeah, we will. You know your history, so you know what happens to usurpers. Charles Edward Stuart, for example. Bonnie Prince Charlie. Yes. His troops slaughtered. Him exiled from the kingdom... More like on the run for the rest of his life. And that was one of the more civilized responses. You<i> have</i> to know that anything I do to stop you is warranted. I anticipated that being your reaction. So do what you must. And I'll defend as I have to.

There are men, with the kinds of resources I have, who would deal with this betrayal swiftly and without mercy. And are you one of them? Am I? Without mercy? Without regard for Taylor the person? Not sure. I'm that angry. That I'm sure of. What if you didn't go anywhere? Did nothing. Most people in the business will think you sent Taylor off, invested with them. Maybe you still can? He who makes the money wins. Or take comfort in the knowledge that the betrayer will suffer for their actions. Suffer how? Internally? Yeah. And when the reversals show up, which they will, and Taylor has to go it alone, with no one to turn to... They will have down years. And they will spiral. It's unavoidable. All you have to do is wait for it. I don't know that I can.

<i>That thing you said. About keeping it 'in-house.'</i> Maybe pride. I have the... craft, you know? But doing it at a remove, that makes much more sense. Oh, so you've been thinking about it, too. The thing you said about saying no to someone like Grigor, that's where I've spent most of my thinking time. How it ramificates out if I don't give the green light. Yes. Mission e-val. Just as you would've for a superior officer back in the day. If Grigor did this, it would be handled cleanly. There would be an accident... falling debris on the street. An overdose. A car crash. A heart attack from a blockage no one saw coming. They are employing a refinement of work flow in this area that is simply unmatched. It would never come back to you as a matter law enforcement would bring. But then... Yes. Then Grigor would have the thing on you forever. Suddenly he decides you'll manage his money for no fee. Then maybe he'll suggest that you pay him, for his silence. And once you let him get the offer out of his mouth, once he let you hear it... Then I have something on him now. Almost as bad. How you say yes or no will determine a lot. And I have a question for you, too. What is your objective? With regards to Taylor? Total destruction. Not out of anger. But if it becomes clear that I can be taken advantage of, that I can groom you, bring you along, prop you up, then lose you and a serious chunk of business, too... I agree. That's not a tenable situation. And it's not tenable to have Grigor in my city, knowing that I'm either indebted to him or that I rejected him. But you should know. Should you move forward, even through me, that psychologically... I do know. Residue. Of course. More than residue. Weight. Whatever you decide. However. Whenever. I am ready. Good luck. Hey, Hall... put extra security on Lara and the boys. The kind they don't see.

<i>So, have you come to a decision?</i> I'm gonna pass on your offer. I didn't have you as a squeamish man. A little delicate, maybe, on the outside. But I thought you were a man like me. A man with steel in all the places one needs it. Maybe we just need it in different spots. Ah. So you're beyond this sort of thing, then. Or you could say this: I was raised in a place that didn't require these extraordinary measures. You weren't. If you don't want to tell me to do it, but want it to happen anyway, that's fine. No. I don't. Fine. Okay... Then I will pull all my money, and I will give it to Taylor. I promised I would give you a warning... This is it. Look, nothing in the way I operate my business has changed. You loved it last week. How can I keep my money with a man who won't kill for it? I don't want Taylor dead. I want them alive to experience all that I am gonna do to them. I'm gonna destroy them in ways that'll make them wish they got what you offered. Sure. Why not? Have fun. But remember, if what you do to them, costs me, we will meet again. Until then, goodbye, Axe.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Good morning, boss. Hey, Chef Ryan. I got up early. Just put that coffee in a go-cup and get the car brought around. Man like you should eat something. So you have fuel to burn. Do I look like I need to fan the fire?

The new, beefed up non-competes. Ready to be signed. They better be iron fucking clad. Believe me, they're tighter than AC/DC in '78. Then let 'em fly.

I took care of the head hunter. It's frustrating Taylor. But they did bring in Mick Danzig. - Want to hire him. - Well, scoop him up. Overpay him. You want Danzig that much? What I want that much is for Taylor to have nothing. With that fucking Russki backing them, my options are limited. So these guys are gonna be a permanent fixture? Till I find a way to get Grigor out of here.

Taylor fucking Mason... I'm telling you. But gorgeous. Like Kate Jackson hot. - You sure? - Pretty fucking sure. I looked right into her... their eyes. It'd be something of a necessity dealing with a sovereign wealth fund. Taylor Mason, willing to compromise their steely fucking principles to get the loot. Well, I admire it. But I'm gonna stop it. This could only be the introductory meeting. No fucking way they got to the Sheik in the first round. We can never let Taylor get to the Sheik. Easy, big fella. They're in my head all the time. First I miss the coup. Then the leader of the coup thinks they're sneaking in here and taking the sovereign funds meant for me. How you doing with the sovereign? Maybe we should scoop up everything they're looking to invest, shut out Mason Capital. Yeah. That's your final term. No Taylor. I haven't closed yet. They didn't react well to the idea of us keeping to our fee level. But we're going clubbing tonight, which you know is my métier. So we'll see what I can do. I'm heading out. I'm gonna trade out this funeral attire for... The all black uniform of the middle-aged warrior? - Exactly. - I'll stand by. Call me when you need reinforcements. Call me when it's over. Just fucking call me. Copy, fratello mio.

Good to see you, Mr. Axelrod. Farhad. Where's my man, where's Wags? You don't know? I wouldn't be standing here if I did. What happened last night? The party continued back here to the lounge on the roof. Unfortunately, the Sheik was occupied and they didn't get to speak. I retired after 3:00. I'm not sure when Mr. Wagner left. Perhaps he overindulged? I want to see for myself. All right. He says the party ended around 4:30 and the remaining guests left. Left this area or the building? He's not sure. He stayed here and they left. The women. And Mr. Wagner. He assumed they exited. Are there any overnight quarters here? No. What makes you think he's here? His cell pinged here as his last location. This is Mr. Wagner's. He dropped it. He'll want it back when you find him. We want to search the building. I'm afraid not, Mr. Axelrod. You are on our soil. All decisions of that nature will be handled by the Sheik, through me. Now, since you're here, the Sheik would like me to go through the terms... First I find Wags, then I sit with the guy in the robes. As your Mr. Wagner said to me: I speak for that man. Uh-huh. Look, put me with the Sheik so we can sort all this out. Of course. But you will have to wait, as everything runs on the Sheik's very busy schedule. Is he fucking in there? It's possible. We call the cops, the FBI? They get turned away. Diplomatic immunity. And it gets very public. Very messy. You say goodbye to managing sovereign wealth ever again. Let me pull security cam footage from nearby buildings, see if he actually left. Fine. Fuck. They're doing this for leverage... 'cause they want to be able to dictate terms on the deal. They put themselves in a good position to do just that. Yeah. Well, we need some leverage of our own. I'm on it.

TAYLOR AND FARHHAD, FALCONS SCENE You see, falcons mate for life. As humans do... sometimes. They're much more consistent than we are. Because they know who they are. The males go out and hunt and bring back food. And the females stay in the nest, defending it, tending to the young. As nature dictates. Yes, that kind of bifurcation of roles makes sense, when you're dealing with a single meal at a time. But when the hunt will provide for generations, one would do well to go with whoever can get the best kill. I like the logic and strength of this argument. Come. Let us take some tea with the Sheik.

Go. Security footage from neighboring buildings says Wags never left. Motherfuckers. What could they be doing to him? Unclear. Have they got him chained up? Would they torture him, rendition him back to their country? Chemicals more likely... Pentathol, perhaps, other sedatives, to encourage docility, but, again, unclear. Have we discovered any leverage? I have something you can play in the room. The kind of scandal that scares the shit out of even the most powerful people in the Middle East. Good. This may be enough to free Wags, and to keep the sovereign money out of Taylor's hands. If I can get in the fucking room. If I don't hear that I've got a meeting by day's end, fuck Axe Capital. I'm gonna call the State Department. We blow this whole thing up.

The final authority on this is behind that door. The Sheik is in there? Well, that's got to feel like a surprise party of one. First the shock and then that warm feeling of seeing how far out of the way people have gone for you. Something like that, yes. Good! It's true, I am not the Sheik. But in some ways, I am. Our powers. Our reach, is similar. His English is better. Yeah, sure. He went to your schools. I had to pick it up watching the Happy Days and Mike Wallace. Though my favorite was Rollerball. The original. You decided that you weren't gonna be one of the players. Instead one of the men above, controlling them. Playing looked like a gas. Until the spikes came out. I prefer to watch the collisions. Set in motion the factors that cause them. Your man, Wags, could have avoided his. But he mentioned Taylor's fund. And somehow word got back to you. Not somehow. I have a very deep relationship with the Royal Family. I leave various oil markets open to them, and they allow my investments to thrive. In hedge funds such as Taylor's. We look out for each other's interests. As I had hoped you and I would. I hoped for that as well. But you didn't act like it. Instead, you tried to stop Taylor from getting the additional capital to allow their firm to grow, make bigger plays. This affects me. Wasn't my intention to cause you harm. Intentions don't matter at all to me. I reward actions. And I punish them, too. As I know you do, Axe, in your slightly smaller section of the world. You should know that Wags was only following orders. - My orders. - Don't fret. Your man will be waiting for you in your car. He's going to have a hell of a headache for a few days. But it will wear off. I do this for you as a favor for old times' sake. This is what I'm telling you. - Thank you. - No sweat, Fonzie. please stop fucking with Taylor Mason. As a matter of fact, by the time you get back to your luxurious penthouse, forget all about them. But be sure you don't forget about me. Hey! Hey. You okay, man? I don't know what's coursing through my body. GHB, ketamine. Whoof. I mean, everything was going great. Then they turned on me like Sharon Stone did in Total Recall. Well, you do look a little like Kuato. Hmm. Hey. They took you to get to me. I'm sorry you got caught up in it. The Sheik never has to say sorry.

Do you have it yet? I could just walk away, just run Axe Cap, forget all about Taylor, just like Grigor told me. Might even be the 'mature' thing. Fuck mature. I'm overmatched. For the first time since I can remember. He's richer than me. And he's willing to do shit I am not. And he's connected to all those other people wanting to do the same shit for him. You walking away? You're not walking away. Because, yeah, he's a Russian Oligarch. But you, mon frÃ¨re, are a motherfucking Oligarch, too. An American Oligarch. You will not relent. Taylor must pay. Well, we have to do it without Grigor getting a whiff of us. Any losses Taylor Mason Capital has will seem suspect. The guy's as mercurial as Sinatra with a cold. Sooner than later, he's gonna pull his money from Taylor, you know. Then he won't care. Just wait it out. You said it, Wags. We make him mercurial. Entice him to take his money elsewhere. Not 'cause he's getting beaten up, but because nothing's happening. He's not losing money, but he's not making money either. We don't put out this fire by pouring water on it. But by sucking oxygen out of the room. Slowly. Invisibly. Completely. I'm sending my fucking doctor over. First thing tomorrow. Whatever you say, Papa...

BONNIE AT HER BIRTHDAY PARTY Well, assuming you pay her cash, chance should be north of 100. I can assure you, I do not pay for it. No. You just beg for it. - Sometimes. - Sometimes it works! Maybe for you and you only. But not for your wife. What you guys don't seem to realize with all of your begging and whining is: Act like a man, sometimes a girl just needs to get railed. Don't you agree? Nobody wants to fuck a sexual panhandler.

May I? Tai chi. The dance of the yin and yang. You ever practice? In my day, I have tried it all. But I always come back to brute force. Much like Mr. Axelrod. You've heard about my banking problems. Yes. And like your Mighty Mouse, ♪ Here I come to save the day. ♪ By providing me leverage. Yes. And no. There are friends I have. Uh, they do similar work, they come from a similar place. Brothers. The Kozlovs. And they're looking to get more of their money into the West. So you've done me the favor of finding the leverage... And you will do me the favor of being most hospitable to my friends. I'll look into it. Yes. Look before you leap. So long as in the end, you leap.

You're in a select club. Female billionaires not named Oprah? Sure. But I meant people who have stopped me from making an investment. I'm not usually so easy to dissuade. You seem pretty easy. If you keep pouring like that I will be. No, but really, thank you. I might've been fooled by that robotics demo. I happen to be expert in that. That's the thing about doing what I do. You're in these investments for so long, you really can't take any chances. I have to dive deep into all these companies, really understand what the businesses are doing. I'm counting on that. Well I'm not gonna carry your fucking water. I don't expect you to. What if I want to partner with you? I'm not raising. You're really not taking on any money? Opening a new fund in a couple months. We could talk then. Maybe we don't go through the fund. You got a personal piece of everything, right? So break me off a piece of your piece. What are you high on from the last batch? A bottled cocktail company. A better mousetrap for backend webforms. Uh, an industrial custodial company, but that one's fully subscribed. Then that's the one I want. Why, 'cause it's so sexy? Hmm? ♪ While there's speakers in the outfield ♪ I wasn't doing the conman thing. I wasn't telling you that there's no opportunity so that the scarcity would get you to implore me for a way in. It really is full. Well, even if it's not a game, I believe in your confidence. How much of the company do you have? Say half. I'll take it. Not on your charmed life. Half of your half. At 1.5x the market price. ♪ To love someone ♪ What's behind the mighty hankering for that specific deal? If you're that deep in it, I know it's the one. Men in business. It was a steady stream of no's and rejections, first from my bosses, then when I went looking for capital. And now that I don't need you, you all want to chip off a piece. I'm a value add. Yeah, I don't doubt that for some reason. ♪ The heart is a muscle and... ♪ Is that what made you leave the shopping network and go out on your own, shitty male bosses? They hired me to pick the products. The ones I rolled out were stone winners. Yet I still had to fight them. Eventually I couldn't handle them not listening to my ideas. How basic they thought. How slow they moved. The way I heard it, you started hoarding all the best products instead of putting them in the system. That way you had 'em when you launched on your own. Well, if that were true, how could I have kicked their ass in the lawsuit they brought? I saw value. I took. You think that makes me bad? Yeah. I do. In the best way.

SARA AND TAYLOR TALKING AFTER THEY GET A PERSON TO DIG INFO ON KOZLOVS I think I'm gonna like him. You're going to like the way he does his job. Already do. He didn't offer an opinion on how we should proceed. - He wasn't in here "pitching." - But had you asked. Sure. I imagine he'd have an approach. I'm asking you though. It's still money. Yes. And we need it. But... If the Kozlovs come on board, that means Grigor has more capital here than the rest of the investors combined. Gives him too much power. He may have already gotten us into a position from which there is no escape, only defeat. Zugzwang, you know? It's what I almost named the firm. In hopes that it would inspire us to get the other fella in that position. Anyway, you're right. If I take the Kozlov money, Grigor is in control. If I refuse the money, I'm refusing Grigor's wishes. And he might pull his money, instead of backing me against Axe's threats. But unlike chess, this isn't just a two-person game, so there must be another option. We say yes. - Make the Kozlovs say no. - How? Well, in order to give me the money, they have to have the money. It's a good thing you didn't name the firm Zugzwang. Would have outed how good a player you are. It's better they don't know. Better they never know.

REBECCA CANTU VISITING AXE WHEN SHE FOUND ABOUT BACKPLAY OF AXE OVER GETTING HER PORTFOLIO COMPANY'S COMPETITOR AFTER HE GOT HALF HER SHARES BEFORE BY MAKING A DEAL WITH HER Ooh, a She-E-O. Nice... Uh, Axe... I was trying to figure out why you invested in that dogshit robotics company. And if I fucked an idiot or just someone really duplicitous. Who told you? Patriot Trust Bank. Trying to drum up more business. Definitely not switching primes. I heard you were denying Taylor Mason leverage. I wanted the Street to know. Now I see what's behind everything: Your wrath. Which I am now going to blunt. I'm gonna get Taylor their leverage. That is not what I would call a proportionate response. Because proportionate responses don't work on nation states like you. I-I don't care if you lie or obfuscate. I care when you take profits that should be mine. Your cleaning company is worth significantly more than it was yesterday. You know what kind of horrible shit your competition was up to? Of course I did. And I would've beaten them, in time, through proper business practices. And now you have. And my piece would have been worth even more if I didn't cut you in. Somehow I don't think it would have gone up so quick if you hadn't. - Really? - Like I told you: I'm a value add. Give me back the shares, fucko. I paid you handsomely. You can buy me out at current value. Take the rest of the ride yourself. If you want to be rid of me that badly. Fine. Half my shares back. Well, as you said, they're worth more now. - So what price, uh... - I get the profit on those. You get only your initial investment back on 'em. And I let you have a clear shot at Taylor Mason. Expensive... But worth it. Good. Done. And we'll take the rest of this ride together. By the way, you got bigger. You now have 4,200 new and hard-working employees ready to step aboard your cleaning company. Our company. Now what? You hungry? I could eat.

AXE MEETING GREGOR AFTER HER PLAY ON SQUEEZING OUT KOZLOVS MONEY BY BANKING ON AXE'S ABILITY TO CALL OFF BANK CREDIT ON KOZLOVS You ready? You want me to go with you? Or send Cook. No. I have to face Grigor alone. I hope he doesn't recognize that I did it. What are the chances of that? If he does know, he's either going to take them out or take me out. Garlic pepper and dill for you. Horseradish for me. I bring what to most would be bad news. The Kozlovs, the men who wanted to give you money, have had some reversals and no longer have money to give. I suppose that is bad news. For me. But for you... these friends are overextended. Perhaps you could rescue them or... and I'm just thinking out loud here... take them out. They are vulnerable. Prone. You could buy all their assets for pennies on the dollar. Your idea of fun is to dangle my friends in front of Axe and watch him feed on them? I'm feeding them to you. Axe just cut 'em down into digestible bites. This is a course of action only the nastiest of the Bratva would take. It is also what I thought you might say, and do. All this raises the question: The Kozlovs, how good friends are they really? It turns out... not so good. I accept this most gracious gift. And in return, you hope what, that the leverage you so crave will now come directly from me? I think you like that Axe has shut the banks to me. Because it makes me more reliant on you. That ends now. Like the once great American Bob Ritchie said: "You can knock me down and watch me bleed. But you can't keep no chains on me." The Kid Rock. I admire him greatly. I need independent leverage. You'll use your influence to open the banks back up to me. This I do. "Only God Knows Why."

Where are we at? Couldn't establish internal surveillance. Fuck. We knew Taylor wasn't gonna leave a key - under the welcome mat. - Who set up their security, fuckin' George Smiley? No. Someone else. I know him by reputation. He's a good man. Thorough. I didn't come entirely empty handed. Mason Capital's remote logins haven't been given adequate scrutiny yet. They will soon, no doubt, but for now... It's not what you wanted, but... MaseCap's positions and trading pattern. Can we do anything with that? We can use size to soak up the alpha. It's not a body blow, maybe not even worth the effort. No, we can do something with that. Unsettle 'em. Throw 'em off their game. Buy up the price on names they want to increase their size in. Costing them upside and picking tiny little percentages off their profits. It'll be like the old water torture... drip, drip, drip. Like the Japanese in W.W.II. Even though the Chinese invented it... No they didn't... Then why is it called 'Chinese Water Torture?' Taylor will try to ignore it. Tell themselves that it's just a few bips here or there. But it won't work. Their need for mathematical perfection will erode their well-being. Then a real mistake can be induced. If you ever get tired of working for him, call me. Oh, she's not going anywhere. She's right, you know. The Chinese didn't invent it. Hippolytus de Marsiliis did, an Italian. - Morning, Peach. - Morning. Take a look. Lock in all these positions, Big Gulp size. Excuse me, Axe. There are other plays that would yield more upside. Yeah. We're limiting the upside for someone else. Oh. Exciting. And a little scary.

I got chicken business with you. What do you know about the Chicken Man? What's the thing? Arkansas Chicken Index. You know? Given that Arkansas is a major chicken producer, and you getting so geeked you broke out the Boss for us, I'm assuming it's an important fucking index. It's a market mover. The numbers dictate the price. And Chicken Man's the guy who puts out the Arkansas Chicken Index. 'Zactly. Latest numbers land today. We need to be long. Because there won't be any chickens? It's better than that. There's plenty of chickens. And the early chicken action is counting on that. But Chicken Man will say that there's very few chickens. And the price will skyrocket. Why will he say that? 'Cause he's supposed to drag his ass out to multiple farms and production houses to get an accurate count. But the guy's Otis of Mayberry. So he'll go to one or two, to make an appearance, but that's it, he's not counting shit. What the guy does is, he sits there on his couch and calls a few of the major poultry producers and just asks them for their numbers. Yeah, I need to get a report on the birds. And they say their numbers are low - 'cause it keeps the prices high. - Right. It's like a teacher letting a kid grade his own tests. If the Chicken Man is wrong, why does he get to stay the Chicken Man? Because he's wrong in the way the producers want him to be. They installed him. And they keep him in place. He's a chicken patsy. I assume you've got a solid source. How do you know the Mobilized Meals gal? How do you know where to find mustache wax? If it's crucial, you get it done. What does he eat? She says he's partial to chicken. Bill... what's your level of certainty? I am not uncertain. Size up the position. Could mean a 300 million dollar win.

We got six more stops. Let's get a good, quick count, and we'll be on the road. Ah, shit. They've sent in the flying squad. There's fucking seven of them. Well, then you got six more guys to deal with than anticipated. What are the chances they can all be bought? It doesn't look good. Arnold Rothstein bought the White Sox, including Shoeless Joe. Get it done. All nighter? I always forget you can do the math. What can't I do? Field surgery? Keep talking, we'll find out.

TAYLOR AND HER FATHER TALKING IN MORNING BEFORE HE LEAVES, AFTER WORKING TOGETHER ON THE PROBLEM ON WHITEBOARD WHICH AXE ALSO GOT CAPTURED VIA HALL'S ISRAELI EQUIPMENT Your guest room is comfortable. Flatscreen in there... - 4K? - Five. You know, you make me proud. My little girl did well for herself. I'm sorry. To me, you're still my little girl. No, I'm not. You were once. Not really. Well, I'm proud. You challenge yourself. Even more than I do. See? You put the spoon on the bottom; it's harder than the fork. Only one point of contact with the surface as opposed to a full line. Harder. You win. You know you get it from me. Define "it." That unyielding compulsion to get it right. Precision. Perfection. Just like me. If you want, you can stick around for a few more days. Yeah? Your mother won't miss me getting in her way back home for a little while longer. Of course, I'll have to eat the cost of the flight home, - but it's worth it. - I'll pay for it. I wasn't... All this? I could have done it. But they didn't even have hedge funds back then. Not that I'd heard of. So I went aerospace. Figured I'd build something... I wish I'd been able to give it all to you, is what I'm saying. Ah. Don't listen to me, kid. Just rambling. Okay. I won't. Well. I'm glad we'll have more time together. I am too. I'm glad you're happy.

I hate to interrupt you while you're on the verge of solving pi, but they're about to put out a new count on the bird surplus. - Shit... - Shit... Number's high. We're out of position. Costing us plenty. Fuckin' Bill. Bill! I got a solution to our chicken problem... A final solution. Bill?! Did he just say...? Oh shit, it's a chicken holocaust. Bill. Bill, what are you about to do? What I always do for you: whatever I have to. Yes, but specifically, what are you about to do right now? What's in the bag, Bill, what's in the bag? A capon with a case of H5N1-B. Just enough to freeze transport on a few hundred thousand infected birds. Prices will skyrocket. You intend to kill a few hundred thousand chickens? They're getting killed anyway. This just accelerates the process, that's all. - That's a good point. - Right, so... But there is a cost-benefit analysis to take into consideration here... that of poisoning the food supply. One I am familiar with. As you know. One that requires meticulous calibration. Or else we're all in Contagion: Gwyneth Paltrow dead on the gurney and Matt Damon as the last living man on earth. If I don't do this... ...it's gonna be a huge loss. - He's right about that. - It's okay. It's not okay! I'm the guy who delivers. Yeah. Most of the time, you are. But, and I can't believe I'm fucking saying this: we can't all be right all of the time. Sometimes... you just gotta take a loss. Forget it, Bill. It's Chickentown.

TAYLOR AND SARA FINDING ABOUT AXE EXPLOITING SECURITY VULNERABILITY TO SNOOP OVER THEIR TRADES AND TAKING POSITIONS HIMSELF TO FUCK WITH THEM BY TAKING FEW POINTS IN PROFIT WHEN IN CASE HE COULD'VE MADE MUCH MORE JUST TO FUCK WITH THEIR MINDS You have it? - Axelrod. - Yes. Couldn't have been a huge money maker for him. So his objective wasn't profit. It was disruption. Strategy was to get in my head, make me obsess over it. And I did, for a minute. - Should we involve Grigor? - No. Can't seem dependent on him in that way. But we do need to seal the cracks in our infrastructure. I'll make sure Cook is on top of it. Thank you.

Fuck me! There's a mistake. That's good, right? Lay back, let them run with it, blow themself up... Only Taylor doesn't make math mistakes. No. It's a Sicilian message. It's a Kappa Mu Epsilon message. They knew they were being watched. A lot of effort to lead you on a snipe hunt. I think they're the one hunting. For something bigger. The Treaty of Versailles.

TAYLOR AND AXE MEETING AFTER AXE FINDS ABOUT TAYLOR'S INTENTIONAL MISTAKE IN SNOOPED WHITEBOARD EQUATION PICTURE WASTING AXE'S ENTIRE DAY TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT Nice spot... for one of us to go over. I don't want to be at war with you. Yeah. I got that you were proposing armistice the second I looked at the algorithm. But you should have considered the joys of peace before you assassinated the Archduke. It's a distraction. To me, and to you. It prevents us both from operating at our full potential. Oh. So you'd like to calm the blood feud for the sake of self-actualization? I'd like to end it because it's the rational thing to do. That's convenient, that you can fall back on what's rational just 'cause you don't like the consequences of your actions. Bullshit. You're frustrated. Good. It's gonna get worse. You're not seeing the board: You walked into a trap with Grigor. You bought into a worthless robotics company to deny me leverage, which I got anyway. And now you've killed a day going through a numbers game. - And here you are. - And here you are. Unable to operate unencumbered. Waiting for the next attack. Wondering where it's gonna come from. Yes. Sure. But you aren't able to operate freely either. You're planning attacks. Then defending from a response. Let's stop. Not waste ourselves on each other. Our time and energy are too valuable. Is that all? I'll offer you attractive terms to invest in my firm. The Street will know that I am blessed by you, but also, that I am giving you a look. In reality, I won't be giving you that look... and since I sealed our leaks you won't be getting them on your own either. But the story will be enough for it to appear that you are in the dominant position. Okay. Fine. Can I trust you on this? You're the fucking genius, figure it out. Did you agree to a truce? Did they buy it? Well. They're a trusting person. So we'll see. Time to set up the next part.

The difference between us, Bob... one of the many... is: I've spent the last 8 or so years putting people in jail. You've spent them making people unbelievably wealthy. Mm. My way tends to gather more friends. That it does. And yet, here we are. Friends. Of a sort. Oh, I have traded pleasantries and handshakes with some truly disagreeable people. And whatever it says about me as a person, I'll admit, I'm willing to do it with a million more of them to achieve my ends. Willingness to fraternize with the depraved... - powerful weapon. - Oh. - You have to be willing. - Yeah. 'Cause someone else out there certainly is. Mm. It's not enough this time though. I'm not going to win this election by that alone. - No? - No. I need your assistance on this one. Starting with the primary. And I don't just mean money. Though I also mean money... - That's a big ask. - Well. The only way I take office is if I outlast the other guy. And right now he's got plenty in the tank to get him to the finish line. I need you to help me drain him of that. You want me to help put you in the State Attorney General's office. I do. Last time you were a lawman, it wasn't so good for me. This time it'll be different. You sure about that? I've seen a lot of Westerns. A man changes when he puts on that star. No sir. Not on the inside. I wear the badge, I'll be able to do for you. Favors reap favors. And I'm sure there's a favor or two I could help you with. I have something in mind, yeah. Name it. I'll do that on the other side of the war. Thank you.

Once, when I was a boy, I lost a hundred bucks I didn't have at a carny game. Hard to feature that. But, uh, before you really launch in-- I was very young. I thought the game was to knock down the pins. The game though, was to get people to pay to try to knock down the pins. Which, of course, didn't go down. And, uh, the guys playing the game were carny workers. And you were merely the-- Sucker. Right. Yeah. Today, your opponent thinks an election is taking place. But he doesn't know how many of his voters are already en route to a free junket with fresh Buffalo nickels in their pockets. Or that parents in his best districts have been forced to drive their kids to school instead of getting down to the voting booths because the school buses were all out of commission. By day's end, it'll be the lowest voter turnout in primary history, which will allow you to eke out a victory. And then you will be the presumptive Attorney General of New York goddamned State. This is where you do some version of the happy dance. Ah. And I know just the jig I'd throw down on if I thought that were so-- flatfoot and buck, like they do in the Ozarks. But, uh, sadly, no matter how few vote today, I'm not gonna book a win. The thing to remember, Black Jack, is that the only folks who win in a Mexican standoff are the rest of us. Because all the Mexicans die. No. T-This situation is different. I don't see how. You have your guns trained on my boy, my boy has his trained on you. Anyone fires, everyone fires. Death to one and all. But if no one fires, everyone survives. -\[chuckles\] -\[Senior\] And thrives. Well, I may not see the narrative just the way you do. Because I may not be as worried about dying in the gun fight as you are. As long as the boy goes down, too. Now is not the time to throw away a lifetime of pragmatism. Perhaps I'm doing just the opposite of throwing it away, Charles. Perhaps I'm doing the most pragmatic thing I know to do. And that is: to make certain this office stays pristine. \[Foley\] At whatever cost. So have no doubt: Your boy shall never be the Attorney General of this proud state-- or of any of the lesser states of our great nation. Not on my watch. And if that means he goes public with some story about metals and bridges and me, so be it. But he can't prosecute it anymore. And I hardly think that story will capture the imagination the same way his degenerate sex life will. \[Foley\] By 5:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon \[Foley\] he declares he's withdrawing from the primary, \[Foley\] or I go public. What he has on you is that strong? If he exposes it, my chances are flushed. Could just be posturing, knowing that you don't actually want to trade blows. Charles Rhoades Senior would have sniffed that out. No. No. I may have to lay down to him, get out of the race. "Always outnumbered. Always outgunned." As Mosley said it best. That's the state of play for guys like us. That's what we need to get us up with the sun. You can't quit. All I have to do is say the words. But you won't. You know... and this isn't easy to say: you were the most formidable opponent I ever had. 'Cause you read me. My chest was out, sure, but inside it, my heart was racing when I knew that you were coming for me. I'll admit that cheers me. Well, then take it in, man. Let it fuel you. Then fight on. You know I will do everything humanly possible right up until his deadline. I'm a phone call away if you need me.

Returns are solid. So I, uh, wanted to come by and say thank you. For backing me, putting me through B-school... Of course. Of course. Your dad, rest in peace, he would have done it. And I see you give back to the Foundation... And for backing me, with your capital and your endorsement when I opened up my own place. Well, a smart kid like you wouldn't come work for me, you know, I had to find some way to keep a little piece of you. Well, I am happy to make it pay off for you. 102 million. Your initial investment compounded net of fees with a profit of 17 million. You're cashing me out? My redemption period ends tomorrow. I wanted to clean things up, bring it over myself. To say thank you. In our business, people never give back the money. So why are you giving back the money? You know, most people are happy when they're handed a hundred million-plus. You grew it, so that's why I want you to keep it. And I'm... I'm thrilled... I'm grateful that I, uh, had the opportunity to do that for you. Talk... Talk more.

Well, I need you. Something you should have thought about before taking Chuck's side. Oh. I was taking your side. 'Cause it's not healthy for you to be in a place of shame or disgrace. No reason to. This all hurts you, actually. How am I supposed to do what I do? No way. This makes you better. This makes you more of an exotic species they need to impress with their alpha dog energy. This office isn't where we talk about me. But thank you. Now... John Rice. Kid walked in here and handed me back my money. Only you? No. Not what he said, but yes. Is it the rejection or the embarrassment? Normally, a guy takes what I consider to be an aggressive line against me, I cut him down like the Mongol hordes. But this time you don't feel the hot anger, the need to destroy. Oh, no, that's still there. But it's not the top note. I don't know what's going on. I... It's... Oh. Some sensation. You're suffering an actual emotional wound. That's why you don't know what the fuck's going on. Your feelings are involved. I don't traffic in those much. There's a world in which this is all your fault. Enraged but listening. What did you, if not promise, then at least pledge to him? You know I take care of school. He was already in college, his dad had set aside money for that. - I did B-school. - What else? Well, to be there for him. Well. Be a stand in. An ear. A shoulder. And have you? All you really offered him was money, when what he needed was a mentor. A bit of personal connection. Did he expect me to take him to the ballgame and the fucking zoo...? You know this is about Taylor, right? This feels like that to you. Like one of your kids spurned you. And through your anger, what you're really wondering: is if it's all your fault. Huh. You may be right. And now I know what to do. Well. We need you here. Upstairs. And in this room with your door open and your lights on. Rebecca was right. You've made this thing bigger than it is. Just like you and John Rice. No. Because I know what he thinks. And what he did. You have no idea who's talking about you. Or if anyone even is. So either you confront it head on, or let it go. But don't keep giving it power over you by staying in the dark.

Axe. Hey. Uh... I know why you gave the money back. I fucked up. Should have done more than said hi each time I checked in on my account. Please. Your father. He was a mentor to me at the old firm. I was supposed to stand in, try to fill that role for you... Yeah. Not that anyone could. - He used to take you fishing. - Yeah. Sun Valley. Fly fishing for, uh, rainbows and monster browns. Yeah. What about salt water? You ever do that? - Out in the deep water... - Dad? No. Never. Strictly, uh... Strictly rivers. Let me take you. Let's hit it. Yeah. Okay. When? - Now. - Axe... Stripers aren't running, but we can still chunk for them. And blues are always a great fight. All that to get me to keep your money? Nah, forget about that. That's done. You make plenty of money, I make plenty of money. This is about doing right. About re-upping a job I slacked on. Come on, let me do what I pledged to do. As your father did for me. Come on. Okay. Yeah. Fuck it.

Rods and bait are on board... We gonna do this right? Won't get any service out there anyway. Yanks are making some good moves... Oh. Fuck that. Let's talk about the real stuff. Your Dad. You know, I used to get my ass out of bed at 4:30 every morning. No matter what, he always beat me to the office. One morning, he's yea deep slinging Asian long bonds... yelling at everybody to bring him a coffee, not realizing it was only 6am and no one's in yet. - No one but you. - Fuckin' right. So you made him coffee? What am I, his secretary? Oh. He didn't drink the office swill anyway. I went out for it. Light and sweet. He was impressed that I'd paid attention to the stuff that didn't matter... because of course it matters. Everything fucking matters. So I should pay attention to the details? And watch your six. Same rules for investing, cards... - And women... - Exactly... He was a hell of a gin player. The partners would play for five cents a point, and he'd rough them all up. I used to love watching that.

Okay. Keep on him. Keep on him. Where is he? - Here we go. - You got him. Oh, he's fighting. He's a fighter. Get him tight on the line. Bring him in. Good. He's a beaut! - Bring him in. - Yeah, he's fighting... All right. You got him? I got him. Whoo! Aah! Nice. - Oh, my God. Look at that. - Yeah! That's huge. - Whoo! - Nice fish. You want to eat him, or let him go to fight another day? Throw him back. Ah. A true sportsman. - Want a beer? - Yeah. Ahh. You know, before you call timeout, you might want to check with Chris Webber. Sometimes, there are none available. Mm. Here we go. Oh, no. You want to hear this. That's why you really came out here. To have me talk some sense into you. The way your dad would have. I know how it is. You have your ideas, your information, your strategies. And it all makes sense up to a few hundred million. And then you get to a billion and you think: how do I deploy all this? You know? Will it work at this size? Is my analysis solid enough? And where's my edge gonna come from? So you scan the horizon, you throw yourself against the questions, and new strategies, on the new scale, present themselves. And you just get bigger. It's the biological imperative for guys like us. Is it, though? What else would it be? Chasing? When I think about managing, much less making, another billion... and not feeling that good about it... I just want to go Natalie Wood off the side of this thing. That's another solid reference. You know your history. You got some philosophy. The money that I spent to educate you did not go totally to waste. The best education, though, is living it. Don't imagine what it's like to run two billion. Or five. Or ten. Just fucking run it. Why do you think I staked you? To be nice? That's what school was for. That's what the Christmas presents were for. The investment? It's 'cause I saw something. A work ethic. Pride. Hunger. But now I'm seeing something I don't like. Contentment? Fear. The mind-killer. I'm not afraid, Axe. Good. Should I tear up the check? Got it in my pocket. Maybe not yet. Should we call it? Sure. Oh. You're fucking kidding me. Maybe it's the fuel line? What, on each of the engines? Nah. We got a short somewhere. This is Vanquisher. 41 degrees North, 71 West. This is Tow-Ur-Boat. We read you Vanquisher. What's your situation? We need a tow. It's a busy day here, Vanquisher. It'll... It'll be a few hours. Uh. Keep us updated on your position if you drift. I'll give you ten grand if you put us at the top of the list. Damn, for real? I would if I could... But we're jammed up... Make it a hundred. I need to get the fuck in. Shit, are you... are you kidding me? Sorry, Vanquisher, b-both our teams are already engaged on an emergency. You and your hundred are gonna have to wait.

Nothing? Nope. So, what do you say... enough folksy bullshit? I know I'm the only one you cashed out. It's truth time, huh? Okay. Good. Here's some truth for you: I might take my fund to twice its current size. Or a hundred. I don't know. I might go to zero. But whatever happens... I'm doing it without you. That was the point. See, my dad was home enough for me to understand what went on at the office. Whom he respected. And, um, that was not you. When I got old enough, I heard all the stories about how you worked. And I knew the situation you were in when the towers fell, before the press even broke it. But you weren't in a position to move away from me. No, I wasn't. And now you are. It took me years to get here. And now, I don't want my fund associated with your name. And, uh, I don't want to be associated with you. I see. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, John. (Plugs the cable back together and starts up the engine, which he earlier portrayed to be broken) Lookit that...

TAYLOR PITCHING AT FIREFIGHTER'S FUND When I was in seventh grade, my father invented an airfoil. Radical. Worth millions. But taken from him by the company he worked for. He never saw a penny, never got his name on the patent, never got anything... except fired, as soon as it was convenient. They stole his contribution and value. He never saw it coming. Never paid attention to where he was vulnerable. Or to what was stalking him. Every other manager walking through that door is probably pitching you investment strategy. Giving you value, small cap, hedge, bond, sector, global. But they're not paying attention to where you're exposed. Or to what's stalking you. - Which is? - Death. Smoke. Fire. Explosion. Seventy percent of your members will be injured in the line, fifty-two percent of their families are going to be owed survivor benefits. You're gonna beat the Reaper? Your members' bravery and service are their contribution and value. And if you're not careful, it's going to get stolen. I know this because my former fucking boss tried to steal mine. I didn't let that happen to me. And I won't let it happen to you...

Hey, uh, I'm sorry I lost my shit out there. I-I don't know if I even meant half the stuff I said, it's just... you know, you reach a point where you're your own man. It doesn't matter if someone is your dad... or if they knew your dad... you just... you want to make your own decisions your own way. - Believe me, I get that. - I was hoping you would. And who knows, maybe there's a world... down the line... where you do come back into the fund. So, uh, let's keep an open channel. In case. For the future. John, John... I tried. I really did. I gave you every chance. But you didn't know where you were in the fucking hand. Just like your old man. Because the part of the story I didn't tell you is: your father may have talked shit about me and the way I went about earning. But he bit off plenty of big chunks from my sheet when it came bonus time. And, yeah, sure, while he was a killer gin player at five cents a point, when the partners upped the stakes to a dollar... they mopped the fucking floor with him. Because he was a piker who couldn't handle the pressure when the stakes were high. And you are a chip off the old fucking block. Maybe I should take an Uber back to the city. Yeah. You do that. But first, you might want to check your messages. \_ Wait, you... you released a fucking interview bashing my approach... You got Birch and Malverne and all those other guys to agree? I didn't 'get them to.' They just happened to. Holy shit. I... I've had a flood of redemptions. And yesterday no one wanted out. Right when no one could reach you? Ouch... Lemme guess, today you are down about seventy, eighty percent on assets under management. I'd bet some of your investors thought they were happy... Some of 'em probably needed a real shove... Problems? Yeah, I suppose I would call them problems. Operational ones. Back office ones. Strategic ones. Enough for Axe to pull all of his capital... It killed him to pull that money. You read the interview. And believe me he'd backed this kid from the start... Others I'm betting bolted at the first sight of greener land... I'm authorized to cut our fees. We'll do a nine percent hurdle rate for the first year... which means you don't pay a cent until we clear 10% returns if you come over to Axe Cap. It's a fucking free roll, but it has to be now... And your reputation may not be entirely intact. Yeah, Sag Harbor PD is going light, but we've seen the photos of him running red lights to Shinnecock with powder on his upper lip. His wife is going for blood in the divorce... At least half. You want a fund manager occupied with that shit? Here's your script. I'm bleeding out. I mean, you... you ruined my business, my name... I told you never give back the money, kid. You said you wanted to stay small. Small enough for you now?

Come on! Bring it in! - Yeah! Yeah! - Cheers, you fucking brigands. Another fuckin' drink. - Hey! - Hey! - Yeah! - So, we caught two blues, a few sea bass and a nice striper... You know, we did a bit better. Of Rice's billion, we put 741 million into play... 430 of it, including your 100 and change, came on board... The rest exited and is in the ether... "Sorry, Vanquisher, uh, both our teams are already engaged on an emergency." A loss for him was a win for us today. I never thought I'd be part of a real life Wannsee Conference. Or that it would be so much fun. Livin' on the edge. Come on. Let's keep it coming. That was some great work on the marine radio. God, I wish I saw the look on his face. Yeah, yeah! You're back above ground, finally letting the team see your face. Turns out you and Rebecca were wrong. But also right. You weren't making more of it? No, sir. The thinnest Google search reveals that people are fucking obsessed... They want to know what whips I use, what bustier I wear, what Chuck sounds like when he squeals. I'll admit to wondering about two of those. Kind of like a stuck pig. Mm. Not that one... The thing is: as I read it, it stopped mattering. Stopped really being about me. Stopped having anything to do with me. Because I don't know those people. And they don't know me. So you snapped the computer shut and moved on? I think you know I did not. I had Rudy's sad social media password, saw what the Mason Capital folks were saying. How bad? About what you'd expect. Gifs, photoshops of my head on Dita Von Teese's body. - Mm. - Everyone piled on. Except Taylor. Oh. Taylor stayed above the fray? No. More than that. Told them to stop. That someone my age shouldn't be mocked for getting her kicks however she needed to. - Wow. - Yeah. I guess it makes sense. After the whole thing broke, they were the only one to reach out. They reached out? I didn't take their call, of course. But they tried. Taylor really did that...? Yup. Guess they think I'm so pathetic as to no longer pose a threat. No, that is the act of an open and evolved person who understands vulnerability... Lame.

Your ex-protégé is a hell of a businessperson. Sniffing out the initial trap was smart. They are indeed. That's what's gonna make it so rewarding when they take the smart business decision to crush their father. Because what they won't know, until it's too late, is how hollow it will make them feel. Uh, remind me to never stab you in the back. Consider yourself reminded. Mm-hmm. What's that you're devouring like a gluten-free croissant over there? Oh, kiss my ass. You know I don't fuck with gluten-free. And this is my next thing. Saler's department stores. Huh. That chain's like a wheezing elephant ready to stumble to its knees. Uh, until I get a hold of it and hit it in the ass with a giant shot of B-12. You're gonna restore it to its former glory? Oh, you're fucking right I am. There's a lot of debt against it, babe. - It's not gonna be easy. - Well, I don't do easy. If I wanted that I'd move to Florida and work on my tan with Bruno. Yeah. It's good that he seemed happy with what I laid out. Mm. No? That is some sweet deal I'm giving him. Are you gonna speak or just sit there silently doubting? Um... Bruno knows you get what you want. So he's made peace with that. But he wants to live in Florida. What kind of life would it be? Playing canasta with a bunch of other retirees. Shuffleboard. Dragging down to the drugstore to get his prescriptions? I don't want that kind of life for him. Nothing to fight for. Nothing to make him feel like he's still in it. It's giving up. Dying. For you. For you, it would be giving up. But maybe for him, after a lifetime in front of a hot oven, it would finally be living.

TAYLOR AND HER DAD FIGHT AFTER TAYLOR HAD TO SELL HIS COMPANY AND TECH Dad, I have something for you. What the fuck is this? A check for 1.3 million dollars. You caved. You folded and took the deal? Government's gonna mothball my project. Or worse, deploy it as they see fit. I assessed all the options and it was the only one left. It was not the only one. It was the only one that allowed me to get the Firefighters back, which will save this place, because without it, there is nothing. There's my life's work, my tech, my fucking dream. Which to you is nothing in the face of recoupment of your investment plus 8 fucking percent. I'm sorry it worked out this way. It's unfortunate but my enemies seemed to have found a way to aim the government at us like a nuclear weapon. How did they know where to aim? How did they know to hurt this venture? I did it. I told Wendy about your dad. Not... Not really. She seemed to know. I just said the word 'startup.' How, exactly, did you and Wendy Rhoades end up talking? S-She just... She was supposed to meet a friend, and the friend didn't show. Oh, Taylor, I got played. No, Mafee, I got played. You were mere confirmation. I, too, spoke with her. At first, I thought it was benign. Then I thought I could use the forum, gain from it, but instead I was infected. The fact that you have enemies like this, the fact that you were once aligned with such despicable people, maybe give that some thought while I'm gone. So you're leaving? We could try ano... You're damn skippy I'm leaving. What's possibly going to keep me here now? Yeah. This is one time I'm sorry my thesis proves out. Thesis? You taught me, don't just have an idea. Build the model that proves it. Sara, call Shaddock with the Firefighters. Tell him I did what I said and we're back in business. Wait, this is all a test? Not a test. A confirmation. I needed to remind myself who you really are. Wendy said it. I didn't want her to be right, but she was. I didn't chose the Firefighters over you, Dad. I chose what you wanted over what I needed. Don't you need me? Yes, and I always have. But the version of you I really need... the one who's a father first... he doesn't exist. 'Cause all he cares about is his own advancement. I'm leaving. And I'm taking my fin technology with me. No, you're not. I owned it. And I sold it to the government. You people. All you care about is fucking money. You know what, kid? You are just like me. Only colder. Yeah. So maybe I'll actually win. Maybe, but I'll say this. It won't feel like it.

TAYLOR AND LAUREN WHEN THEY GOT BENSINGER'S SON How, with your vast knowledge of NYC nightlife, did you settle on this place? It'll make more sense to you soon. Never mention his dad. Never mention business. Unless you get him to. Then how am I gonna... By being yourself. Wow. This place. The colors. Throwback. I've never been here before. Taylor picked it. You did, huh? Yeah. I dig the ironic camp of the place. Nope. I saw your face when you walked in. You weren't smiling ironically. You were taken with it. As I am. It makes me get back in touch with the child-like part of myself. Not childish. Child-like. I embrace that part of me. It's the most creative, most engaged part, the part that continues to push the rest of me to grow. Yeah. Yes. That's right. What's more evocative than the smell of your favorite cereal from when you were a kid. I don't know why I said that ironic thing. Because you are human, and we are here in this city, at this time. You were worried you gave yourself away. Don't worry. You did. And it was great to see. What was your flavor? Honey Smacks. When I was a kid, I only got to eat cereal once a week. My father wanted me to have better habits than he did. I still feel a little guilty when I eat it. But I love it. And this place. You nailed me, Taylor. That was impressive. Get to know each other. Taylor, I'll circle back. Frosted Flakes for me. Grrreeeeat! Lauren, you were right. I'll set up the meeting. No guarantees beyond that. My father sees things I don't, which is why he is who he is. But I feel comfortable getting you in the room. That was a big fucking risk you took, going off book like that without telling me. Nah. I knew you'd crush it. It was fun as hell watching you think on the fly like that. You just come alive to the challenge. And then seeing him have that feeling of someone recognizing who he really was. You picked up on all that, huh? Think I like knowing you're watching that closely. So, nah, that wasn't a risk at all. But this... this is. We broke some rules here. Must be why it was so much fun. For the record I kissed you first. But maybe we don't mention this to Sara either way... Don't mention what to me? Lauren's got some moves that don't include shots and nightclubs. She landed us the Bensinger meeting in a very child-friendly way. Nice. Good to know. Yeah, but keep it low, I don't want to ruin my rep.

Alright everybody, let's do this. I'm going to need to withdraw from the board. Me, too. - The fuck? - How come? We sold our shares. Deal just came through. Nice premium, couldn't pass it up. You bailed on me without even hearing my plan. - Who'd you sell to? - I'd prefer not to say... Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway. And when I do, I'm gonna turn my focus from this business, onto each of your personal holdings. And think about just how I can take them to zero. I'm gonna run you down into the dirt. And I'm gonna smile like the Joker while I do it. Taylor Mason. Mason's meeting with Sanford Bensinger, they're going to have control. Resignations fucking accepted. This meeting is postponed until the board is reconstituted. With the amount of convertible debt Bensinger controls, he's our largest creditor. He can convert it into enough shares to dwarf our position. Then we'll get diluted and our voting power shrinks. If he backs Taylor they can run the company right from underneath me. Or fire me. Kind of move he's made many fucking times. You know him? Well. Maybe we can go sue for peace. Work him. I do know him. But the kind of peace that he'll grant is the type that has my head on a pike. You have a remarkable way with people. Thank you. But believe me, we can't work this guy. No, it's time to punish him.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rhoades' motion to dismiss was denied. Boom! Body shot! Deposition's confirmed for Thursday, but we should postpone. Oh, yeah. I know. That's what I would say were I my own lawyer. Yet we press on. If he doesn't get to depose me, I don't get to depose him. It has to happen now. Ah. The NFL. I heard you were down to the final three. Yeah. Even for me, this kind of chance? I know. Of course. Most folks, when they get their first job on the Street, cold-calling out of phone books, they think the idea is, get the mark to yes. But the way I saw it... and it bought me a 911 my first year... is never give them a reason to say no, because if you take "no" out of their vocabulary... "Yes" is the only word left. And right now, Chuck Rhoades' accusations, his insinuations... That's their no... unless I can make it clear <i>he</i> was the one who crossed the line. You have to know going in... Depositions are unpredictable beasts. In depos, I've seen things you wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire? Yes. The very best cases gone forever, like tears in rain. No replicant... no lawyer is gonna rattle me. Mr. Axelrod, you say the U. S. attorney harassed you, that he overstepped the bounds of his office. Are you sure he didn't have legitimate reason to come to your place of business? At that hour? No. His wife worked for you. Could have been coming to see her. His wife had quit working for me. She'd also quit being his wife. Don't be cute. If you want this to help you in the PR department, keep the digs off the record. What about Mick Danzig? Do you deny bribing police to wipe out his arrest? Of course. I would nev... Fuck. Yeah. Let's not give him a perjury charge for nothing. I know you don't get rattled, but if you get rattled, even for a second, don't answer. Just ask for a break. So... you want a break now? Keep 'em coming.

 

 

 

 

 

Hey. Come in. Bite? Oh, God, no. I'm glad you came in. I was gonna come see you. About? A purchase I'm considering. An impulse purchase? Naturally. Sizeable? I'm guessing it's something you may not even particularly need. People are saying if I do, it'll unleash the hounds... which makes me want it even more. That's good. Back when we started, you wouldn't have been able to recognize the motivation until long after you bought it. Well, back when we started, I was just rich, not super-rich. You know, being a billionaire... I never get to talk about this with anyone 'cause who's gonna give a shit? But being a billionaire, when you walk into a room, it's like being a woman with a perfect set of tits. Or great legs. Or eyes like yours. You know exactly what everyone's looking at, and you know exactly what they want. You know what that's like. Okay, player. Identifying the fact that buying can be a surrogate for power and that outside authority isn't something you do well, this is progress. You've come a long way since we started. I guess... considering when we started I was staggering around crying along with the half of us still breathing. But knowing isn't enough. You've got to exercise control. Don't get into a bitch fight over nothing. Don't buy it. You nailed Lumetherm Power. Deal crumbled. I covered at $31.19. Nice. You said $32-ish, but I saw it was going even further, so I waited. Whoa, living dangerously. All right. Good job. You just made us another $18 million. Yeah. Thanks. We got sidetracked. You came to me. You're thinking about leaving. Uh, well, it's... crossed my mind. Is this about comp? No. God, no. You've... you've always made that clear. I'm better paid than anyone in my med-school class except the guy who invented the synthetic bladder. I'll short his company, give some speeches, chop him down to size. It's not about comp. But it is about value... mine... and growth, as in whether I'm still growing. I love this place, but I do miss seeing more than a handful of other patients. At-risk adolescents, women in crisis. You know, using those other muscles. Where's this coming from? It's been on my mind. Your value to the firm is absolute. You just saved me from making a huge mistake for dick-measuring purposes. So let's do this. Spend as much time away from here as you want. See other patients outside. But stick with me. Thank you.

All right, ladies and gentlemen. We are up 32% year-to-date, and we are open to all moneymaking ideas. Longs, shorts, sells, covers... all Alpha welcome. The choppy waters out there are perfect... for us. For the average investor, hell no. But never forget... what's bad for him is good for us. If... if we're as smart as we think we are. If not, the heat'll melt us like an Almond Joy in the sun. So, are you smart enough? Some of us fuckin' are. How about you, Pouch? How am I supposed to answer that? You already have. Sadly. What happened on Eureka Trans-ship? You knew they were gonna whiff their numbers. Why didn't you bang the short harder? You left 5 fucking percent on the table. I thought they were gonna whiff, but I didn't know. You are such a pussy on the short side. Go home and get your fuckin' shinebox. Insulted him a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. Axe, you saw my position. You could have upped him. That's what I'm paying you for. You see an opportunity like that again, you grab it like it's a horse cock and you're Catherine the Great. Okay, okay. Saldana, why are we still tied up in those hospitals? Baby boomers. They're getting old, so they're getting sick. When the group reports patient volumes, it's gonna overshoot street expectations. We're talking 10% move. That incremental revenue will drop right to the bottom line, and the stock's gonna pop like a prom queen's cherry. Good fucking answer. It really is. God damn it. Okay, new-idea time. Donnie Caan, what do you have for us? I think Apple still has room to move north. Really? Our investors pay us a 3% management fee and 30% of their profits, and you want me to tell them we're buying some fucking Apple? Sorry, Axe. I-I guess I'm just not seeing the matrix right now. That's a little unsettling, Donnie... Since seeing the matrix is your entire fucking job. It's kind of like if you were a hurdler and instead of jumping over the fucking hurdles... It's okay, Donnie. You'll see it again. Hang in. Okay, guys? Let's go out there, bring some meat back to camp. Or some nuts. Hunt or gather.

We are honored to share this privilege with you, Mr. Axelrod. With you, too, Mrs. Axelrod. There's no sharing, Ellis. It's Axelrod Hall now. No. Of course. We understand. You think you do. Now, I saw that when I came in here, you don't remember me, Chad. I know who you are. But you don't actually remember. We've met before. I caddied at The Spoon when I was a kid. It was the perfect summer job. I carried your grandfather's bag quite a few times. Your bag, too, Chad, in the summer after middle school. How funny that we all end up here. Now, here's the thing. A lot of numbers have been thrown around... 100 for the naming rights, 25 for your name to come down. But there is one number that really matters to me... 16. And we'll see if you still think it's funny, Chad. $16 is what a caddy got paid for a loop. Four hours of humping bags, smelling sour cigars, and watching all of you lie to each other about your golf scores in the 95-degree heat, but I was happy for the job. That 16 bucks... and I would do two loops a day, so it was $32 on a Saturday, $32 on a Sunday. By the end of the weekend, I'd have 64 bucks. 16 weekends, memorial to labor day, $1,024. That was his spending money for the entire year. He'd stretch it out until the next summer. Pretty much. Until... And you were there for this, Chad... Your grandfather asked me to read a putt on 3. It was a left-to-right leaker, and I told him so. I'd seen the putt all summer long. He closed the face, pulled it, missed it by a foot. You laughed at him. You made fun of his eyesight. And he turned to me, and he fired me right there. Not from the round, but from the club. Now, I needed that $16, but he didn't give a shit. Because he was embarrassed to have missed a putt in front of his grandson. Are you saying we are here because of that ancient bullshit? That's right! 16. Which is why I am presenting you with a check for $25 million minus 16, which leaves you with $9 million. That is bullshit! - This is unacceptable. - Ellis, this is bullshit. We will walk out of here if you don't honor the full amount. No, you won't. You need this $9 million. Because none of you... not one... Has done a single day of work from the moment your miserable prick of a grandfather fell facedown in the sand in Palm Beach. And after reviewing your holdings, your business interests, your debts, I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy. So pick it up, put it in your pocket, and walk out of here. Or I will. Let's get out of here. Mnh! So, now the Axelrod name will be forever affixed to this building for all time. Or until some guy richer than me wants it to come down. You really started something.

And you know what ATM stands for, right? Yes. I don't wanna be the kind of person that gets off on that. I really don't. But... I've learned this, and it's one of the positives of getting older. It's better to accept who I am than fight it. Ass-to-mouth, by the way. Just so that we are speaking the same language. Oh, we are. Sometimes on the drive home, I'll roll it over in my mind. You know, what is it about a woman taking it into her mouth after a little raw-dogging that just seems so right? And it's this... that I'm accepted as I am. Completely. For my good qualities, sure, but also for <i>all...</i> of my filth. And I appreciate a woman who is that giving. I truly do. But there's more to it, isn't there? The... act you're talking about has to do with power dynamics. Dominance. Maybe ask why this is coming up for you now. Is there a work connection? Someone you feel isn't looking at you like she should? Maria Saldana. Wow. What happened? She was kind of a bastard about her bonus at quarterly review, and then she went and got an offer away. Yeah, but she's still here. Yeah, but she threatened to leave, leveraging us to make a bigger offer, which we will, and I think she stays. - You feel played. - Yeah, I do. Then why did you make her the counter if you feel that way? Because she's great at her job. Her P&L's always green. She grew her capital from 50 to $300 million. Men renegotiate. If they do it this way, they get fired. So it's really not because she's a woman? No, it's because she got out of line. You know that we're upping Donnie Caan's capital... tripling it. I asked Axe why. He said, "Donnie's loyal, a good soldier." And in your mind, Maria's not. It doesn't matter. I'll keep her. You gonna tell me about that smile? Well, I'll keep her, but she won't have much fun. It's my duty to make an example of her now. You cannot leverage us. So over the next two years, she'll get cut back in ways she can't control. She'll get less deal flow, less information will fall into her lap. At the end of her deal, she'll be worth a quarter of her current comp. Ass-to-mouth, whether she likes it or not.

You know, my fucking eyes are watering here. How many pints of that shitty toilet water do you splash on yourself every morning, Spyros? You think maybe it's gonna help you get some tail? Here's a tip... it's not. It is a lot in a confined area. - I cut back a little. - Yeah, maybe cut way back. - So? - It's a good slice of pizza. - Bruno. - What is it, Bobby? Tell Mr. Purkheiser why I love your sauce. Uh, I use the San Marzanos. - Tomatoes. - Yeah, yeah, tomatoes. You make 'em without 'em, it wouldn't taste right. Right. More expensive? Oh, yeah, yeah. But like I say, it wouldn't taste right. Wouldn't be <i>verace.</i> <i>Verace?</i> The true way you make a pizza Napoletana. This place is the pizza of my youth. He's been making it just like this since I was a kid. You know... Normally, somebody wants to waltz with me, I find myself sawing a 20-ounce rib eye on the East Side with a $500 Cabernet. I am different from the other children. Mm, well, that is clear now, Mr. Axelrod. When I was 11 years old till I was 14, I was a paperboy. I delivered the <i>Journal News</i> <i>every day after school.</i> And when I finished my route, I'd pick up a YumTime Scrumpet. It was my reward. I did this every weekday for three years. And a while back, I brought my two boys here. And I showed them my route, we stopped for a Scrumpet, and they were colorless, over-sweet, petrified. Needless to say, my two boys were underwhelmed. So was I. Didn't taste as good. So I did some research, and I learned that the recipe had changed. Bruno! What's the name of those tomatoes again? Uh, the San Marzanos. Bruno never let me down. YumTime let me down. Public company now. Gotta boost profits for the shareholders. Synthetic ingredients are cheaper, margins are better. Hutch III is playing a quarterly game. It's just a different world. Well, Hutch III is flying around that different world in a G6. I'm guessing Hutches I and II flew coach. It's classic, time immemorial... Hutch I starts it, Hutch II grows it, Hutch III blows it. Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations. Come on, Purk. You have to see that. If you don't throw in with me or someone like me, YumTime goes the same way as Ebinger's. What's Ebinger's? That's exactly what you wanted me to ask, isn't it? - Hi, Mark. - Ms. Raichlein. I have a 10:20 tee time, but we wanna hit the range first. And I requested Stewart on my bag. Yeah, um, Mr. Kellum from the membership committee wanted to speak with you. Oh, okay. Um... is he in his office? No, he stepped out. Well, then, I'll pop back in after the round. I had to give away your tee time. Uh, what are you talking about? I don't really know. Something about your account being in arrears. - That is not true. - My bookkeeper... There has been a mistake. Well, you can't play golf till it's been resolved. Meeting to order. Let the record reflect that two guests are present... Mr. Robert Axelrod, shareholder, and Mr. Michael Wagner. Welcome, gentlemen. Now I think we're all familiar with Mr. Axelrod, by reputation and through the letter that was circulated. And I feel that this might be a good time to hear directly from him. Mr. Axelrod? Thank you. Folks, my proposal is simple. Return to the original recipes and restore the YumTime brand to its former glory. And then what? After a good quarter or two, you spin it off? Do you see what's happening here? This... carpetbagger, he comes in here, he shakes things up, he sells the company off in pieces, and then he dumps his shares the minute it ticks up. He's a raider, plain and simple. Not my intention. Do you have any idea of the cost of returning to the old recipes? We can't remain competitive. Yes, sugar instead of corn syrup, and the elimination of polysorbate and other crap will add to the per unit cost and cut into the margins. And destroy profits. How do we explain that to the shareholders? No explanation necessary. We make up the difference by streamlining inefficiencies and trimming bloated executive compensation and perquisites, beginning with the corporate jet. - Okay, <i>you</i> have a jet. - I earned a jet. I earned one, too. I started at the bottom. And the Scrumpets taste fine. You came on as a 22-year-old vice president and you raped the Scrumpet. I eat them. I eat Scrumpets and Dingdoodles and Kookoonutties, and they are good. They're not <i>as</i> good. But they're still very, very good. Delicious. Listen to me. I move that effective immediately, Hutchinson Bailey III be removed from his duties as Chief Executive Officer of the YumTime corporation. Hang on a minute here! Purk, you're being conned! Jerome, this is not what we discussed. Evelyn, there have been subsequent discussions. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Motion carries. You traitor. My father is turning in his grave, I assure you. Your father thought you were a lunkhead. Please, find the door. Fuck this. I'll get my company back... somehow. And fuck you, Axelrod. Well, now you're off my Christmas list. I now move... ...to remove Evelyn Benson from this body and delegate her seat to Robert Axelrod. - What?! - Second. I'll go to the press. If you do, you'll be burned down with your own match. But if you don't, we'll write you a nice endorsement, and maybe you'll get another board. You old cocksucker. The same might be said of you, my dear. All those in favor? Motion carries. Good luck, Evelyn.

You got something in your stomach now. The cops are far away. This is when you tell me what the fuck transpired inside that head of yours. I was blowing steam, I guess. You're not tanking anymore. I've seen your runs. You pulled past even. Open road ahead of you. It was an $8 million day to the good. I had a drink. Three. Watched the Yanks lose. And then there was just... nothing. You don't feel anything. Maybe a twinge when I get crushed. Nothing when I'm up. It happens. You ever do this thing where you pull up your positions and just stare at them on the screen? Try to really hold on to all that money inside? No. Does it make you feel happy when you do? Like it's enough? No. Right. Because what drives you doesn't understand "enough." Well, last night, I was doing it... Staring at the numbers. I look away from the screen, out the window, and I see them out there, eating everything we planted like it's a fucking salad bar for them. And then just... rage over how fucking stupid they are. Eat, move, shit. Eat, move, shit. Repeat. I mean, how can things that dumb have the gall to occupy the same space that I do? Does that one make any sense to you? Yeah, more than you know.

How does the day start at Axe Capital? What does Axe do? The real answer is anything he wants. When you're at his level, you're more like a nation-state than a person. There is no schedule he's following. I mean, when he shows up, the meeting starts. I got it. He's rich. Let's go. Rich? Rich is a Marquis Jet card, uh, flying out East on a chopper. This is more like, "Hey, I want a cheesesteak. Send some guy to Philly and bring them back for everyone." Jim's or Shank's? Both. And Tony Luke's. The fact is, he does not need to call meetings. Everywhere he goes, they form around him. I mean, he's like a... Like an aircraft carrier in the center of a strike group. When he turns left, battleships, destroyers, subs, they all turn left with him. - I could use a coffee. - Yeah. - Anyone else? - In a minute. Keep going. You just don't know where his focus is gonna stand. Sometimes, you hope it lands on you. Sometimes, you wish you were invisible. Because when it does land on you, he sees everything. No, no. I did get the offer, but I did turn it down. That's what I was coming to tell you. Good. Because it seemed like maybe you were trying to tell me if I didn't match it, you were gonna leave. No, I was... trying to be loyal. You don't try to be loyal. You just are. Or you're not. I am. Well, that's heartening, Mafee. Information flow. When you are Bobby Axelrod, you don't chase information. Information flows to you. - What kind? - All kinds. It could be an owner of a sports team inviting him to sit in a box at a... at an all-star game or some leader of an African republic looking for a-a handout. While the rest of us are plugging away, ants, he sees the whole board. Hey. You always said to call this number, and only this number, in a circumstance like this. I understand. This has to be an in-person conversation. I'll tell you a time and place. Hey, and thanks for the call, Constantine. You're a good friend. You never really know what he's doing or why. I mean, he says he's going to Morocco to check out a seven-star hotel, but then you find out he's really in Hangzhou making a web-portal play.

Oh, hey. Pouch needs a minute with you. Later. Metallica's playing one North American gig this year. Tonight. Quebec. We going? You're half right. You got the conn, brother. And like I always say... Don't fuck it up. I know. - There he is! - Hey! There he is! Kill 'em all, baby! - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah, kill 'em all! Axe! Fuck, fellas. It is good to see you. - How are you, bro? - Metallica? Holy shit. I couldn't be more psyched if you told me Jillian Barberie was gonna ride my face like American Pharoah. That's beautiful. I want that on my tombstone. All yours. Hey, where's Freddy? Not coming? Yeah, he's late, as usual. Yeah, you know what? We should leave his ass. Rule is if a guy is flying you somewhere, he gets to show up last, step on the plane, close the door, take off, right? If you own the plane, you don't wait. That's the rules, but not for you guys. Never for you guys. Come on. Ah, that's not Freddy. Shit. Dude. How far do I have to go not to be bothered? I wanted to catch you... - Sorry I'm late, man. - Freddy! Freddy! Hey, what's up, brother? - Hey. - Hey, jump on. Jump on. - I'll be there in a sec. - Okay. Have to talk about the Cross-Co. short. I didn't understand the play when you had me make it. Now I do. We should get out of the position. I'd never do that. It's the only way to eliminate potential conflict of interest. - There's no conflict. - Come on. It won't look good. You set the position then jump onto the board of YumTime. If I made moves... ...based on what looked good, I'm damn sure I wouldn't have this puppy right here. And I'm on lots of boards. Those don't have contracts they're dumping with Cross-Co. Trucking. A guy I talked to who traffics in the name says he's hearing whispers the contract's going to be cancelled. This opens us up to contract steering, manipulation. It opens me up. I didn't have the board seat when we took the short position. And I don't have anything to do with the day-to-day at YumTime or their contracts with vendors. There's no paper that says I do. So, the only thing you're open to is making some money, which would make a nice change. Like your wife says, hold the fucking position until I tell you I'm done. Come on. Come on. I guess that meeting's over, huh? Shotgun! All right. Inside information, specifically. Where is it coming from? Where does rain come from? The sky. God himself. Information comes from everywhere and all at once, from guys who owe him, guys he's worked, charmed, hired, paid off for years. Sell-side traders looking to get a gold star next to their name. Disgruntled employees, execs at the company in question, an analyst covering a stock who feels underpaid. Like rain, it comes. Sounds like it's great to be Axe. It is. But it's a zero-sum game. Kill and eat or be eaten. I mean, don't kid yourselves. These guys are like kings. Someone is always coming to assassinate them. You ready, Quince? Yeah. But you're gonna love what I just heard from this British fruit, Farraday, my guy on the stock loan desk. Guess which hedge-funder's got himself in a precarious short, ripe for a squeeze? If you're talking Bobby Axelrod, this just became my favorite round of the year. - You have details? - I do. Hit first. And talk. I want to know what stock I'm running up his ass. It's a trucking company... Cross-Co. Right here on the course? I'm President Emeritus. I do what I want. All right. To me. Come on. Eat those. - Wow. - Fuckers. There's nothing I can do. It was the only diamond in my hand. You know I can still read you, same as in ninth grade, right? I know when you're lying. I know when you're telling the truth. - Which is fucking rare. - Blow me. - Truthful request. - Exactly. - Eat another. - Guys, come on. You even think about letting me win? - My plane? - Oh, yeah? When we boxed in my basement, you think about letting me win? I'd try. You'd stick your fucking jaw out every time you threw a cross. It would just, like, sit there, begging to be hit. Freddy the cheat. Yeah, but I seem to recall beating all of your asses. - Indeed. - You had the ape strength. Ape smell, anyway. You know, the best thing was is that you always thought that you were gonna win, Axe, right up until the moment that you fell. You know, some of us have changed. Like when we used to play this, I always used to try to shoot the moon. Back then, I was reckless and, you know, I had nothing to lose, so I'd risk it all at the same time. But, you know, not now. - You're still reckless. - You just mask it better. You still need to crush, not just win. Still need to knock me the fuck out in my own basement. Whoa, Freddy. Take it easy. What the fuck? I mean, we used to go at each other hard all the time out of respect. That's the kind of friendship it was. What kind of prick would he be if he took it easy now? Hey, I'm just pointing out that while he's telling us he doesn't shoot the moon anymore, he just shot the fucking moon on us. Unless you can take this, which you can't. No. Sh... Freddy, you're the one who fucked that one up. I mean, you saw what he was up to. I mean, I caught on a little bit later, but I didn't have the cards to do anything about it. But you did. I mean, you haven't changed at all. I mean, y-you were just waiting for somebody to stop him, like Ike... - Right. - ...and you were just trying to preserve your own position. So, now I'm a dick 'cause I'm trying to win? - Yes. - Yeah. - You're the dick. - Yeah. You're the dick. The king. Who protects his flank? My client is getting hungry. You are. We'll take an hour... in a minute. Flank. Prime brokers, trading arms of the big banks. On paper, they're supposed to serve two functions... Provide credit and execute trades. They're like loan sharks for guys too rich to use loan sharks. Example. They let you trade on margin, lever up your book two, close to three times, even these days. And when you stumble, they're there to catch you, even if it means they take a short-term loss. Why would they do that? Their business model is like a casino's. Take care of the whales. So, it's in their interest to serve him in whatever way he needs. Right up until the whale gets beached. Wags, Roytan upgraded CXC, Cross-Co. Trucking, to a "strong buy." Shit. That's bad for our short. Target? They think it could hit $90. Fuck! Double scoop of shit. Look at that e-mail. They're recalling our shares. Pulling the fucking rug. I'm calling Axe. Hey, Chief. Sorry to bother you. Roytan analysts pumped it up on Cross-Co., target of $90, right when the prime e-mailed to take the stock back. That can't be a coincidence. No. Son of a bitch. It's a short squeeze. Someone found out about our position. Guys on the prime broker desks have looser lips than my first wife after the second kid. What do you want to do? Bleed some off? No. We got to hold. It's gonna pay off big time. Get the fucking prime broker on the phone right now. Farraday. Wags and Axe. Gentlemen. Don't "gentlemen" me. We need another day on Cross-Co., plain and simple. Axe, you know how important your business is to me, and ordinarily, I would, but we need the shares back now. Or you can buy in on the market. Why don't you buy the stock for us and hold it as a courtesy? Ordinarily, I'd take the loss for you with a smile, Axe, but no accommodations. This one's coming from on high. - Quincy's office? - No comment. You are making a $100 million fuck-up here. You spent years becoming my main prime. You're losing me now. I'm pulling my business. My hands are tied. If you don't make the borrow on the stock by opening bell tomorrow, I've been instructed to buy you in on your entire position. This isn't coming from me, Axe. Axe? I hung up on the little tool. Good. What now? Scour the 13-F for Cross-Co. Find me the top 10 shareholders. Hedge funds, not institutions. I need someone I can call for these shares. You got it.

So, what happened on the plane, man? Oh, nothing I'm bothering you with. Oh, come on. When I thought that Cynthia was cheating on me, who'd I turn to? Yeah, but... Now, look, dude, I can see it in your face that this isn't some typical speed bump. Someone's trying to fuck me. Oh, so it is just like Cynthia. Yeah, but it's more expensive. I'm being short squeezed. Okay. Uh, someone's trying to make a stock go up, and I need it to go down. If you short a stock, you borrow someone's shares who has them, betting that the stocks are gonna go down. But sometimes, the stocks go up, then you have to buy in at the market price. And sometimes, the stocks just keep going up. Right. Being squeezed on a stock, Axe? Yeah, they're trying. Eh, they're always trying. Oh, yeah. This is Purple Urkle. THC level... 24.3%. - Ooh! - It's connoisseur cut. You guys said something about golf. This will be beautiful out on the links. Oh, yeah. One step closer? Whoo-hoo! Yeah, his life goal is to play on at least one course in every country on the planet. - And then... - Augusta, baby! - Gentlemen, have fun. - Will do. Guys, you go on ahead of me. I got to make a call. I know who's squeezing me. Chuck Rhoades' goddamn father. Augusta. I just flashed on the last time I played it. Farraday's boss, Quincy, and Rhoades Sr. In the clubhouse together, drinking fucking Azaleas. Crusty old bastard's coming after you. Feels like it. So, big shareholders of CXC. Yeah, you found one? Yeah, but you're not gonna like it. Ken Malverne at Vista Verde. Fuck! All right. Get with his office. Have him call me as soon as he can talk. You're gonna make a deal with that devil? Gonna try. Garth Sykes called about our exposure on Cross-Co. He's looking for you. This kind of shit worries him. You usually handle the worries. But today, you are. My sources says that Rhoades is proffering a witness against Axe Capital. Who? I don't know yet. I will. Find out. Also, I have reason to believe that Rhoades, Sr. Is making a play against me. Use it. Go after him. Well, I'm gonna see if we're gonna hold these gains here in the futures market... Hey, I thought you'd left. I was waiting for you. Hey, you see this? Cross-Co. is on a run. - Are you... Are you concerned? - Turn that shit off. Come on. Let's go.

You got your balls in a vice on that one, don't you? Well, if you heard that, you must know why I'm calling. Well, it'll be fun hearing you say it. I need to borrow your shares to keep my short position. Mm. What's your proposal? 8%. 8%? This must really matter to you. It does. Well, I'm long the stock, obviously, which is on quite a little tear, but if you're right and this company tanks, my position is screwed and I'll be holding it forever, waiting for it to recover. But you're gonna have to... make it more worth my while and pad my loss in the near term. More than 8%? Okay. 10%. 25%. Twenty-fucking-five?! Am I a poacher, Axelrod, or am I your goddamn savior? Am I a plugger or am I the smartest guy on this phone call? How much do you want it? I want it. Done. I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of telling this story. You got your borrow. Uh-huh. Hey, Axe? There can be only one. Hey, Axe? Are you all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know... You know, it's just bullshit. You know, I came out here to unplug, but I can't, um, you know, really unplug. I... Do you mind me... You mind me saying this? I just thought I'd get to a point where, uh, you know, I really fly, you know? Just feel free, let go of all that earthbound shit - and just, you know... - I hear you. ...fly free. Yeah, you should, man. You should. How do you do it, man? Mm, I play, man. I play. ♪ Harvester of sorrow ♪ ♪ Language of the mad ♪ ♪ Harvester of sorrow ♪ ♪ Language of the mad ♪ ♪ Harvester of sorrow ♪ Yeah! ♪ Harvester of sorrow ♪ Who gets to talk to Axe? Anyone can talk to him. But you better not waste his time, and you better not be wrong.

Hey, Garth. What's up, brother? Hey, I'm not in the office today, but believe me, I'm all over this thing. Sounds like you at the end of the goddamn world. Listen. I got people asking why the hell you've drifted non-compliant. Well, we notified you as a courtesy. No, I was notified because of the 1.5 large that I have with you, which may not be a lot to you, but it's a mountain to my folks. Last time I listened to you, I slapped my name on a building for the ages. If that isn't enough, maybe the fund isn't for you. You know, you can go to many other funds and get 4% nice and fucking quiet. Go buy some T-bills. But if you want the high-altitude returns, you got to be prepared to go where eagles dare. Your granddaddy made a fortune in bourbon. Did he fold up shop when they passed the Volstead Act? How the fuck do you think you got to where you are today? You think you got a suite in Churchill Downs because of your winning goddamn personality? If you want to stay, stay. You want to pull, then tell me in the morning, but either way, get off my dick.

Hey. You walked out on me. That kind of thing could give a girl a complex. I'm sorry. My loss. It was a work thing. How was your show? It was your loss. Peace offering. What are you drinking? Your best tequila on the rocks, three limes. On him. Coming right up. If it's any consolation, I almost missed Metallica, and I flew in especially for them and my oldest friends. That's tragic. Why? Uh, you don't want to hear about it. Okay. You know, the road manager told me who you are. Not sure what you're worrying about. I wouldn't be. Well, you'd be surprised. At what? How difficult your day job is? Ludicrous, I know. Look, I get it. But I barely have a dime. And when I want to do something, I do it. When I want to go somewhere, I go. I guess I'm just lucky I do what I love. Yeah, me, too. Most of the time. And when I don't, all the choices are mine, which is the fucked thing. I think I just figured that out. Well, this is getting tragic again. Don't go all Charles Foster Kane on me. You know, I've never seen it. Seen Rocky seven times. But never Kane. If you, of all people, have never seen Citizen Kane, you have to, immediately, projected on a big screen, on film. That's doctor's orders. Promise me. I promise. I'm not into missed opportunities, just so you know. Good. Me neither. And I'm not down with regret, so wherever you see this night going, I'm okay with it. You know what? If there were two of me, I'd go for this right now. But there's not. There's just one. You're married? Yeah. And it's a real thing. Road manager didn't tell me that. I get it. That's cool. She must be, uh... a real classic. She is. Fuck. I don't usually misread situations like this. Don't. Don't. You didn't. No, I know. You totally led me on. And now I'm gonna let it go because you made the tough choice, and that's rare. Your wife is lucky. Although you know what? You're probably the lucky one. True. Don't forget it.

Describe the setup once you left Axe Capital and hung up your own shingle. Well after your years of service, if you leave with the right combination of loyalty and ass-kissery, he wishes you well. And? He gives you a chunk of capital, seed money, and in return, you give him transparency on all your ideas. You open the kimono, so to speak. More like a colonoscopy. He makes bigger, faster moves on all your ideas, often rendering them useless, but then the tips start to come in, and it's all worth it. Uh-huh. So, he directs you to make trades on his behalf? Not exactly. Just say information starts to show up. And what does he get in return? A taste. A sweet taste. So, he was an investor with you? We couldn't find any documentation or linkage. Not exactly. There are accounts with names of holding companies, LLCs, re-insurers on them that clear to other accounts with other names. At what point... At what exact moment did Axelrod instruct you to buy Pepsum Pharmaceuticals? Never. What the fuck? What... What the fuck? You will be prosecuted for lying in this room, Mr. Decker. He never instructed me. But you believe it was insider trading? I know it was. How? Who told you? It was a voice on the phone. If it wasn't Axelrod, who was it? Well, I can't be 100% sure, but if I had to guess, it was probably "Dollar" Bill. Bill Stearn. Which is odd, because his portfolio is in industrials and agriculture. But that is the last thing you need to know about how this all works. Because you can't know, not really. That's why even though I opened up my own place, I could never have really done it, been him. There's so much you have to keep in your head... Balancing, weighing, deciding. You can't let anyone know all of it, maybe any of it. I mean, to be Bobby Axelrod is to keep so much in your head, just to keep it from blowing up your brain takes Benedictine-monk-like discipline.

Hey. Hey. Where are the guys? Uh... after party with the band. Oh, I picked that up for you. Thought you'd like it. Yeah, nice. Thanks. Thanks, man. What the fuck's wrong? I'm in some shit. I fucked up. Yeah? Fucked up how? Um... I heard your Cross-Co. play on the runway, and I-I-I jumped on it. You rode along on my intel? I piggybacked because I figured you always know. You stole my fucking idea. You're like Paulie Pennino. Who? Paulie, Adrian's brother, putting the Shamrock Meats logo on Rocky's robe. You should've asked, man, like any friend would. If you had, we could have worked it out to get you in on this without attracting attention. Instead, you... you promoted me like someone at work. They don't get to be here. You do. I know. I-I know. I fucked up. I fucked up. I-I put pretty much everything into that short. And then, when the stock took off, it was too late to ask you for help, and now I-I'm getting a margin call. Broker's saying I got to make good by morning, but I can't cover. I'm ready to... I'm ready to puke all over myself. How much? How much do I owe? Yeah. I want to know how much our friendship's worth. I'm in the hole just a little over $210,000. I'm gonna be pretty much wiped out. This your brokerage? Yeah. I'm sending instructions to my people to guarantee your margin. Axe, I... It'll turn around in the morning. Stay short. Don't cover until then. The thing you got to remember is if a short's going against you, you got to be able to withstand the pressure or it'll crush you. You see it all so clearly. I don't lie to myself, and I don't hold on to a loser. The moment it doesn't feel right, I let it go, get away from it. Let's call it a night. Plane leaves at 9:30. Thanks, man.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- Sell everything. - Everything? Take it slow, control the bleeding. Then we'll dump sector by sector starting with telecom. - People will think... - That I'm out. - sync and corrections by Caio - - www.addic7ed.com - Hey, Tito. Morning. No blemishes. Air cell one-tenth of an inch. Perfect color. It's beautiful. Double yolker. Give me the odds. About one in a thousand. But I got six in a row once. That's quintillion to one. Franchise that fucking hen. - Thanks, Tito. - Of course. Hey, you wanna trade? Sure. Jesus, Wags. When a guy says sell everything, he gets a chance to take it back. Fair enough. Not gonna. You gotta say it. I already said it. Do it smart, do it so we don't get hurt, but do it. Once we're out of telecom, we get out of tech. Look, if the investors hear about this, they are gonna wonder what the fuck is going on. No, they're not, 'cause you're gonna call 'em and tell 'em. Tell 'em what? Tell 'em that we're shutting down. Give them the heads up. They can start looking elsewhere. And next week? If you change your mind? Well, let's just get through today. Bye.

The girl at Metallica concert gave her the idea that she does what she wants when she wants which he used to fake his retirement in order to sell his position on Insider Information. He uses information and events around him, cards he's dealt with and uses them to gain an edge or further his future plans. Constantly makes connections of various events and people and the situations for his benefit or achieving his plan.

You either appoint an independent custodian to handle the final audit or... You give those to the accountants or the lawyers. - You handle the investors. - I will. But you and I both know there are certain ones who deserve a sit-down with you. This is why you're here? Alex Collins. First person to put $10 mil into the fund. Jesus, when did you become such a hoarder? Frances Kingsley. Buchanan University. - I get the point. - And finally... Raul Gomez. New York City Police Pension Fund. Shit. Gomez was a game-changer. He was the first real player who saw what we knew we had. What a great day that was. If there is a reason for all of this... a professional one... you know I am the one guy you can tell. It'll help me to backstop. There was... Hey. Thanks for coming. - You're gonna make those calls. - I heard you the first time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When I was at Metallica, I just had this feeling... it was so brief... that there was some other kind of life I could be living. In each of us, there is another self we do not know. What's your other self? Professional soccer player. Well, no. No, no, no. You know what my first dream was? Famous Broadway dancer. You got the legs for it. Mm. Look... if you wanna do this, go ahead. But don't just slide into it. Make a decision. - I have. - Then tell your people. Don't make Wags do it. You owe them that respect.

Taking on the Police Fund as a client was one of the proudest moments of my life. You know, Lara comes from three generations of cops. - Her grandpa walked a beat on... - Bushwick. Of course I know. I deeply appreciate you taking a flyer on us back then, when no one else would. You were a cocky prick with terrible table manners, but I knew there was something. I didn't keep my money at Axe Cap because I like you. If you pull up stakes, you're handing me a $1.5 billion problem. Time comes, I'll find you another fund. Like who? Rangewater? Yeah, for example. Solid returns. Smart guys. Overleveraged, though. - Then PKZ. - No way. They have no idea how to manage risk. None. No fucking clue how to short. Bear market, you're paying 2% to underperform Vanguard. So you're starting to see the problem. Picking a fund's not that different from picking a stock. I'll find you a winner. Here you go, guys. First Solar. Late July 2007. No. No, you're not making me do this again. As long as I'm an investor in this company, I'll... Okay. Okay. 2007, mid-July. Broke out in good volume. Went up to around 120. We were out of the sector till August. We left millions on the table. That was on me. Google. Mid-June 2004. That's a trick question. Didn't go public till August. IPO'd $19.6 mil shares at 84. Closed at $100.34. It was a good day for both of us. Cyberonics. August 2004. Started mid-20s, went to 40s. Then the FDA dinged its nerve stimulator, and the stock tanked at 13. We saw it coming. Everyone else was trying to catch a falling knife. We made $7.4 mil that day. How'd I do? How the hell would I know? I remember I gave you a quiz like that the first time we met. And it wasn't the fact that you knew so much. It was how you lit up. These companies are living organisms to you. And I knew that if I gave you my money, that you wouldn't sleep until you put it in all the right places. You would do whatever you had to and wouldn't care what it looked like. That's who I needed looking after my cops, who I still need. And in case you can't tell anymore, you still lit up.

Do you believe this shit? The CEO of Mundia-Tel and office presidents in six countries caught cooking the books. Company's fucking bankrupt. Stocks tanked 89% already. They're talking about suspending trading. Whole sector's swirling down the cesspool. The whole market is going with it. Good thing we were out. Yeah. It sure fucking is. - A-again? - I thought I got it all out. ...that body sushi. Raw fish off a stripper.

You fucking genius. Where is everybody? They quit already? Bathroom, mostly. Body sushi at the strip joint. You didn't partake? I've built up a tolerance. How did you know about Mundia-Tel? Fucking bellwether. When it went babaloo, it sucked the whole sector down the dumpers with it. Of course, we were out of telecom completely, and you hid it under some rumor of your midlife crisis or whatever? Couldn't afford to get caught in a race for the exits. As long as the rest of them thought I'd lost it, they wouldn't follow. I was starting to get nervous it was real. Holy shit. It was real? For a minute there. More than a minute. Felt like... freedom, you know? Like I could taste it. The Galápagos? I almost got on my boat today and didn't get back off. Why didn't you? Because I fucking love this place. I love what I do. I love what we do. We gotta be ready to push back in hard, tomorrow or the next day, after the market correction. We lever up again...

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The day after Pearl Harbor, everybody knew a Japanese invasion would be coming. Air raid wardens. Anti-aircraft artillery. Cities blacked out. Mothers and fathers staying by the door with baseball bats and kitchen knives, bellies full of fear of the invading hordes. But everyone was wrong. What happened on American soil next? Nothing. That's right. The invasion never came. Turned out Pearl Harbor was the best those sneak attacking motherfuckers had. What came next was a war that unleashed the might of America. What came next was a victory that left us as the most powerful nation on Earth. Fuck, yeah! This company... This company will not wait for an uncertain future. We will make our own future! We will fight back hard. We will mobilize the war machine. And those who would try to bring down our house will see their own houses fall!

Hey, take it easy! You're at 120 feet per minute. You're gonna blow an Achilles! Aah! What's wrong? I'll be right back. Hey, I'm not getting anywhere with Lawrence Boyd. - The problem is... - Solve it. All those years of thought and planning and calculation that you and he put in are for nothing, and there's a high probability that it does go wrong. So it's in both your interests to... I'll have to call you back. You took $250,000 out of the fund. Why does it bother you? I still have $3 million in. Why'd you take it out? It's my money. I can do whatever I want with it. Or can't I? Dollar Bill earned a $10 million bonus last year. You know how much he took out? 2 grand. You've known about this for weeks. You're bringing it up now because you wanna know something. What is it you wanna know? Why don't you take it all out? I am not my husband. And I am not going to be the shuttlecock that you two smack back and forth. You two just sniffed each other one day and decided you didn't like the smell. So now you think you have to do this thing, but you don't. You don't have to do it.

Dollar Bill is hard, man. Inspiring. He makes me wanna lose 30 pounds and stockpile automatic weapons to protect all my sister-wives. Will he be exonerated? It's the government. If he is, it'll be in five years, and no one will remember it. Look... just because he's not cooperating doesn't mean they can't tie you to Pepsum, doesn't mean they can't get you on something else. But we have an opportunity now to broach a deal. I'll never settle. No. Now's the time you drop that. Chuck's guy, Connerty... he's rattled. They're weak. And I think we could get a deal that would be very, very good for you. Look, guys try to sell me deals all day. I decide when they're good. The one I bring you will be the best one that'll ever on the table, 'cause that's what I do all day. I see that. And it won't really hurt you, grand scheme, other than emotionally. It'll seem like a win to them, and they stop. Give them more time, who knows what they'll find? I didn't do anything that anybody else in my business doesn't do. I just did it better. And I will not tar myself with an admission of guilt - over some... - You wouldn't plead guilty. Any success that his bullshit investigation yields is toxic. He cannot just walk around using rumor and hearsay and destroy lives and businesses. I won't allow it. That needs to be the message. He's got nothing. Billionaires all over the world are trying to bring me down every day. This guy? He can't even bring me to trial. He has failed at his job. Why the hell would I give him a win? What win? It's your win. You go free. You pay a fine, get busted down to a family office. That's nothing. It's headed that way anyway, isn't it? No!

Get ready to head to Brooklyn. Tonight's the night of your baptism at the church of Barclays. Lawrence Boyd has invited you to his box. Washed in the blood of the lamb, baby. How'd it go down? Uh, maitre d' at a place I go had $1,000 on him to tell me when Boyd came in. Sent over a '61 Château Latour and picked up his dinner, courtesy of Bobby Axelrod. - Well played. - I have my moments. How you holding up? My lawyer today told me they don't have a case against me, but I should still settle. Can you believe that? Yeah. I'm guessing you don't mean that in a "fucking lawyers" kind of way. I think you have the best fucking lawyers. They know the law like you know the market. And if they're giving you a piece of advice, I think you should consider it. Wow. How does Chuck Rhoades terrify everybody so much? I don't give a shit about Chuck Rhoades. I care about protecting this family. We're gonna be pariahs. The kids got uninvited to the Bancroft party, and nothing's even happened yet. So if there is even close to an easy way out of this, I hope you would take it. Since when do I take the easy way out? This isn't some stock play. It's no different. It's all about tolerance and risk. Look, you don't win, you don't get to where I am without tolerating a lot of risk. We. Where we are. This is real, Bobby. You're risking our lives. You could go to jail. We could lose everything. And you can make it all go away and you won't? I can't. Not like that. Why not? Because I don't get on bended knee and pledge fealty to the king. It's not who I am. It's not who you married. Well, that's just fucking stupid. The ground is shifting, and you don't even see it. Or you refuse to see it. But if this were some stock play, it wouldn't be about pride. You'd have already cut your losses. Lara, the ground is shifting because I'm the one moving it. Lawrence Boyd invited me to his box today. That tells the Street, tells the world, that my stock, our stock, is about to rally because Spartan-Ives does not back a loser. I gotta go to work.

I am trying to save you and me and him... and your father. Do you trust me? Just because I trust you doesn't mean I think you're right. Ask me anything. Are you gonna open up the book on Axe for me? The whole way? - What about the oath? - What do you want to know? What's he thinking right now? What's he doing? He's looking for a win. Always. He needs to find at least a small win in every endeavor, every exchange. What happens if he can't find one? Then he'll play a different game, with different rules... ones you don't know, no one knows, where... he can make your loss bigger than his loss. A lose-lose scenario. And that doesn't bother him? Of course it does, but Axe came from nothing. So unconsciously, he fears... No, he may even expect he'll have nothing again. So he... loves to put that same fear into others, especially if they're not familiar with it. Like the Eads family. The naming rights? I heard about that. But that's just the part of him I know... that he's allowed me to see. But you know him better than anybody. Well, I think I do, but I'm not really sure anyone can. He's most likely ahead of you... Especially when it looks like he's not. And if he does go down, he will pull you down with him. I'm not afraid to prosecute anybody. Okay, it's not about that. It's about you being your alpha self, not letting him pull you out of your game. That's his goal in all his deals... get under their skin, get them to make a mistake. If this was a different case, uh, at this stage, I would pursue a plea agreement. You would. It's a cardinal rule... you don't trust your career in the hands of a jury of 12 random crazy people who might decide a case based on a wink and a smile and not the law, which they can't fucking understand in the first place. Would he take a deal? He'd settle if he thought it was a win. If he thought he tricked you, even better. The only deal with teeth would have to take him out of business forever. That's the only deal he would never take. Would he take a family office? Would he admit guilt? Why don't you ask his lawyer? No, they have to come to me. If they come to me, then it's on my terms. I can get him to come to you. Are you sure? I mean... what if the Axe we're dealing with now... What if that's the part of him you don't know about?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How long have you been here, Dimonda? Those things charge by the hour, right? I'm running a story on you. I'm hoping to get a comment. That's not why you're here. You could've called. You're here 'cause you have something big... to you. Something you think you can hurt me with. Goes like this... September 11, 2001. You're in a lawyer's office. You're being fired by your partners. A plane crashes into the North Tower. People are burning and dying. And everyone you work with sees it happen. So you call a broker... Lincoln Chang in Jersey City... and have him short aviation stocks in the European markets. Then US hotels, shipping. You go against it all. The second plane hits. Everyone you work with is dead. People are lining up to give blood. New York's bravest, your wife-to-be's brother, runs into the buildings to help. He never comes back out, while you sit back in your chair with a smile on your face making hundreds of millions of dollars. And you take that money and the rest of everything your dead partners had, and you call it Axe Capital. That about right? Congratulations.

I'm surprised you let those protesters out there beat you to it, Sean. Huh. So you've been expecting me? - Good. - Yep. The vultures and the hyenas always share the carcass meal. As you know, I'm not just a fund-raiser for the symphony hall and the grounds. I am also a custodian of the legacy of the arts... which requires some difficult conversations. Since the Yuletide season is down the road, I couldn't help thinking about the real life Saint Nicholas. That's Nikolaos, the fourth century bishop of Myra who was famed for his anonymous donations to the poor children, sailors. If he was anonymous, how do you know he did it? We need to rename the building. Sure. That's 100 mil at 3.3% for three months, which makes 100,825,000 dollars you pay me back, and we part as friends. And hey, I won't even charge you any interest on what I paid the Eads family. That's comped. We're not in a position to give the money back. So... A name change to... Freedom Hall or Enterprise Hall. Majestic titles that would bespeak a general... Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah. Keep going down this road, and my lawyers won't stop until I own the goddamn place. So it's either Axelrod Hall or Go Fuck Yourself Hall. You choose.

You hate me. I don't blame you. You lost more than I could ever imagine that day... colleagues, friends, including Lara's brother, Dean. I met Lara in an aid tent. She was just out of nursing school. I didn't know she lost her brother in the Towers. But when I found out... I realized what I'd done. It brought it home. And I want you to know this... that when I started donating to the Firefighters Foundation... It wasn't calculated. It was out of real admiration. Total BS. Paul. Talk to me. You sound like a fucking politician. You gonna buy us, too, Axe? How much do I cost? Really, Mikey? Try to show a tiny bit of restraint. They're entitled to their anger. Mikey, too. You all read the articles. You know I made those trades after the first tower was hit, before we knew it was terrorism, before I knew my whole firm was gonna die. That's your fucking excuse? No. What the papers didn't say is that I kept trading after the South Tower was hit, too. In fact, that's when I stepped on the gas. Oh, man. Am I a politician now? I'm not running and hiding. I am standing right here, telling you, I didn't do it for me. I have plenty of time left to make myself some money. I did it because even though I knew my colleagues, my friends would all be gone, their families would still be here, and they would be my responsibility. Was it coldhearted? Yes. I thought I had to be. Maybe I was wrong. Look, the reason I'm here is because I value you guys... my relationship with the department, but especially with this house. We drank together on the anniversary. You matter to me. And even if I don't matter to you, I wanted you to hear it. Hmm. So thanks for giving me the chance.

Tell me about today. If you're successful enough, people think you can do anything, and then you start to believe it, too. You mean you do. I'm not Superman. That's what I'm trying to get across. But today? I might've forgotten. It's hard not to engage in a little magical thinking when everyone else is looking at you like you're some combination of Warren Buffet and God above. I don't buy that. Magical thinking is... if I clean the house, then school gets canceled tomorrow. And this? I'm not wishing or guessing, and I'm not usually wrong. And when you are, you take your medicine and move on. It's what makes you great. But today, your own words, you missed something. Somehow the idea that all the guys... I asked Mafee, and the moment he said that everyone else agreed that it was the wrong move, I had to stick it out, had to prove that I was the difference maker. To who? Mafee? Danzig? Of course not. I agree. They all idolize you already. It wasn't about proving anything to any of them. Look, you want me to fix the part of you that makes money. But it is attached to the rest, so... Like I said, this is gonna take a little while. Let's talk about you for a sec. That's not how this works. We've never done anything the way it works, and we're not exactly starting tonight. How are you handling everything? I wanna know before we go on. Grant me this indulgence. The Donnie thing threw me, to be honest. There's an empty space in the world without him. The fact that... I missed it. This man, this... patient of mine, dying. And he wouldn't let me in, despite whatever was going on with him. And you. People withhold crucial information all the time. We learn to manage our expectations about those close to us, don't we? So they don't turn into mistrust or... paranoia. When I was young, I figured if I was truly there for my patients, I could get them to be truly open with me. I quickly learned that's not the case, but you still hope. Really? That's what you were thinking about when you were young? Fuck. You chose the right line of work. I was just thinking about getting rich and getting even. Have you? Yeah. Mostly. Does it make everything all better? Why doesn't it? Because the world isn't simple. Like with Donnie. You keep going back there. I don't think we can ignore that you missed today, for the first time in forever, right after he died. Okay, go ahead, doctor. You connect those dots. Well, you used the words. Getting even. - When I was a kid. - And today? Bombing the trade, were you somehow evening the score for Donnie? What does that even mean? Donnie was a friend. Everyone here matters to me, and I go out of my way for all of 'em. That's why I got him the best medical care. The same as when Mick Danzig gets tackled on his lawn with a machine gun in his fucking hands, I'm the one who pays off the cops to make the problem go away. That's what I do here. I take care of my people, and they know that. And so should you by now. So are you ready to tell me who you were trying to prove something to? Yeah. Should we say it in unison? And were you trying to prove you were a difference maker for good or bad? Were you trying to reward or punish yourself? Come on. Where you going? - We're not done! - Come on! - - Whoa! Oh! Unbelievable! I'd have given 30 to one odds you'd miss with the phone. Then you're definitely not seeing the market. I can do a phone. It's gotta be bigger than a phone now. Do you remember our first building? Ooh! Globe would've gone through the floor. Okay, double or nothing. I wanna do a computer. Oh, my God. You're like Kobe firing up shots when he's two for 18. No doubt in your mind the next one's going in. Kobe? Steph Curry. Jordan, maybe. Don't give me Kobe. Shooter's gotta shoot. Unwavering belief in our own capabilities. It's essential to a point. Keeps us functioning at a high level. Until it isn't, right? Maybe your self-image is creating... a blind spot. We're not on a break, are we? No. Why couldn't I have seen it before? Well, let's assume your blind spot usually works for you. It's fairly essentially if you don't feel indestructible like Superman. How are you gonna risk billions every morning? But it's not working for you now. So you need to figure out what part of your self-image is false. And then you either need to live up to it or lose it. Interesting word... "false." Like, uh... when someone knows that they have to tell a lover goodbye. But they can't quite do it, so instead, they sleep with them one last time. Then they have their own unspoken goodbye, not letting on that everything's changed until... after the night is over. I'm not sure that's what we're discussing here. No, maybe not. But it came to mind, so I said it. Isn't that what I'm supposed to do? In a sense. Something I said? Let's go outside. I never cried over Donnie, you know. You wanted to? I think I should have, maybe. Last time you did? - Oh, I don't know. - Sure you do. Let's turn here. I like to wander from time to time. It's our little expeditions that keep me around. Digging in the dirt, getting under the process. But I was supposed to be home hours ago. Last time you cried. Fuck. Okay. You know what really nails me? These YouTube videos, soldiers coming home, surprising their kids at school. Even better... baseball game. So the guy subs for the catcher. Kid goes to the mound, he gets ready to pitch. He throws one. He hasn't noticed. And the catcher goes to the mound, takes off his mask, kid sees him, and the dad just wraps him in a hug. I have no idea why, but if I stumble across one of those, I am gone. Does it feel good after? Yeah, it does. Jesus. Nobody knows that, not even Lara. It's okay for that to be private. Do you know what's going on? You're not gonna tell me it's because my dad never came home? Well, I think that might be in there, but I think we resolved a bunch of that. No, I think about the mask itself. I think about what it means that the dad pulls off the mask, and he's not only seen but loved for who he is underneath that hard metal exterior. Well, that guy's a hero. He deserves the love. And you? What happens when you take it off? Will you still be loved? By the guys here, your kids, Lara? What if you're not perfect? What if you miss one every few years? Yeah. What then? Let's stay with Donnie a minute more. We've now gone as far as we possible can without getting to it. Donnie. Fine. Donnie. But first, tell me what you've put together. I know you used him as a shield. I don't know how exactly. And I know you left his family well off afterwards. That's all true. So you should feel great. You saved your kingdom and rewarded richly the knight who fell on his sword so you could do it. A king who does not mourn that knight and that goes on building his own castle. Oh, so that's why you missed on the trade. You loved him, so subconsciously, you're punishing yourself. I stole from him. His time, Without his permission. Doctor presented me with a chance to get Donnie some experimental treatment, not a cure. But it could've extended his life a... few months... and maybe long enough for him to have seen Christmas. But also maybe long enough for him to testify against me. And... I stopped that from happening because it didn't suit my purposes. And I'm punishing myself because I cannot believe I have the capacity to do that to someone I care about. That's your fear? That even when you care about someone, you can use them for your own ends. If that is true, I don't like what it says about me. It may be true, but that's not what this is. You're punishing yourself because you're understanding that you didn't care about Donnie. Not really. That's what scares you. Yes. When I heard about Donnie's death, I... I felt relief. And all the rest... the sorrow, the sadness... it was... it was buried way down. Like it didn't exist at all. That's right. So the question you've been afraid to ask out loud, but have been whispering to yourself ever since, do you wanna ask it? - Do I have to? - I think you do. I can't say it for you. Well, people who have the capacity to feel nothing... ...they call them sociopaths. Is that what I am? What do you think? I don't know. This is how - you manifest guilt. If you didn't have it, you wouldn't have lost the money, you wouldn't be punishing yourself. But it is a... crucial time. Your switch plate is removed, your wiring is exposed. Your blue ones go where your red ones should, that's for sure. A normal person wouldn't engage in the behavior. A sociopath wouldn't give a shit. You're somewhere in between. You are practiced at turning off your feelings. Do it enough, it's a pattern. Keep going, they die. So it's either fix it... ...or close yourself back up and see what happens. What we did tonight was pretty heavy. There might be aftershocks. Yeah, I know. You did to me what I do to companies. Took me apart, put me together again. You seem tired. Or are you just disgusted at what you heard? Take this away with you. You are a difference maker, but you're not a god. Pancreatic takes everyone. It's like the market. It does what it wants. And no magical thinking was ever gonna change that. So no, I'm not disgusted with you. For whatever reason, when it comes to you, that's... that's just not on the table. You know, some of your wires aren't where they should be, either. I can't argue. Is that why you've been looking at other shops? That's what you've been drilling for all night. Where were you thinking about? Was it Insight? Point One Four? No, Zenobia. Yeah, Zenobia. You think you'll be different there? Fixed? Working in a simpler, safer way will allow you to step back from the edge? That's for a different session.

You're smashing back every one of their questions ...when they fucking ask them. Like Agassi in his prime. The dam is gonna break soon. I don't need the Coach K bullshit right now. Well, what do you need? Not sure. Something. Throw those books aside. No, take those books, go back to the office, and I'll see you after. Here's how simple it is. I've outperformed the S&P by 38.7% over the past 15 years. But that's not at issue here. The issue is the turmoil, the aspersions cast on my fund and me. I'm talking about 9/11, arrests, whether I run a clean shop. And I understand that. In your shoes, I'd factor it in, too. But I'd also factor in the true cost of missed opportunity. In the span of... say, what? A year? Nobody's gonna give a shit about any of that. But the growth that you will have missed out on? That's gonna eat you from the inside. In a year's time, I'd be happy to revisit. In a year's time, you're not gonna be able to get me on the phone. When I walk out that door today, we are friends for life, or you don't exist to me ever again. I'm about to go on the run of a lifetime. I am aligned. I feel it. And I know you can see it. I'm here, but in ten seconds, the bullet train leaves. And if you wanna make money, climb the fuck aboard. <i>Yes!</i> - Whoo! - Yeah! I shouted out when you called me. Holy<i> fuck,</i> we're back! Great, boss. Come on. Come on! Can't imagine how the bonus comp sessions would've gone if it went the other way.

Good morning. It is. - So? - "So"? That's what you have to say to me? Wait. I feel like I walked in halfway through the play. I decided I wasn't gonna say anything, but now, looking at you, sitting there, smiling in my face, fuck it. You sold me out. What? I tell you something compromising, and the next thing I know, the fucking feds, your<i> husband,</i> is up my ass again. Hmm? Just so you know, and... I wanna be clear as daybreak on this... If I go... You go with me. I have your web traffic on our server here, and from your laptop. You got quite a dark side, don't you? I would imagine this would make Dr. Wendy Rhoades look very unprofessional. And, of course, the whole world, including the office of the US Attorney for the Southern District, and the Attorney General, would see it, too. It's funny. I never instructed my man to take these when he set up the baths, but... I suppose on, uh, on some deep level, I knew he would. And<i> you,</i> being such a master of the subconscious... or is that mistress? I suppose you would've known, too. I didn't sell you out. Polygraph me, motherfucker. I tell you about my issues with Danzig, and then in, ooh, the space of, what, 48 hours, there's a fucking investigation underway!

Been here a while? Yes. I didn't expect you back so soon after how you left. <i>I don't believe that, not anymore,</i> <i>not after you broke into my computer, opened my files,</i> <i>- ...read my session notes...</i> - Jesus. <i>You stole the evidence you needed.</i> <i>I had no choice.</i> <i>'Cause you can lie to me</i> <i>about how it makes you feel, but you can't lie to yourself.</i> <i>And if you're right there in the middle of it,</i> <i>with a bunch of criminals,</i> <i>what do you think that makes you?</i> That's a hell of a question to have to answer. I know. I am so sorry to have doubted you. This is the part where you tell me you're gonna destroy everything you showed me, right? I will destroy all copies of it, whether you believe me or not. What else are you prepared to do? Your bonus. I was planning to give you two million. It just went up to five. How do I know you mean it, that I won't walk down to my office and find it's one million and another four you're keeping invested here for me? I'll wire it to you now, to your own account. Wags, five sticks wired now to Wendy Rhoades' personal account. <i>Whoa! Powerball winner.</i> Check your e-mail in two minutes. I will. I'll triple it for that recording you played me just now. It's worth that much to you? Consider that my opening offer. He's still the father of my kids. I had to try. I quit, Bobby. Chuck was right about one thing. I can't be in denial about... ...what this place is, what you are, any longer. Not after what you showed me. I know you trade on inside information and by other illegal means. Or you let it be done for you. You encourage it. Are you taping<i> me</i> now? No. I just need to hear myself say it. Look, I can explain... Good luck with that... and with everything. Goodbye.

Oh, what the fuck? Come on. Hang for a minute, Bryan. Listen to what Bobby has to say. I can't sit with you. Sure, you can. You want to. Same way you want to stare at the lions at the zoo. Bach walks around thinking he's better and smarter than everyone. - And you know why? - 'Cause he is. That's right, only he says you're just as smart. Even more focused, younger, hungrier. Dangerous. I don't know about any of that. I know hard work. Yeah, you work hard. But it's much more than that. You're driven the way only someone brought up from nothing, the way we were, can be. Chuck Rhoades, for all his ambition, he can never need it the way we do. But the guy's had a safety net all his life. You and me? We never had a fucking net. That's why it can never work, in the long-term, you under him... Because he can't understand what matters to you the way I can. Hmm. I spend every minute of my day going after guys like you. That attitude, that focus, that ability... it's not being fostered where you're at, is it? It's being thwarted, in fact. And eventually... what you're feeling will turn to disgust and self-hatred, and in the end, apathy, if it hasn't already. Oh, that's your diagnosis? What's your cure? You know what it is. Come work for Bach's firm on my account. It's a different kind of integrity where at least you know you're never lying to yourself. I'm offering challenging work. You'll be allowed to win... expected to, on your own terms. And, of course, you'll be rewarded. Seven figures, starting. And an ability to help your family,<i> really</i> help them. Your mom... she won't have to work so hard, not at all, unless she wants to. Time to take your seat at the grown-ups' table. That's not who I am. I can't picture it. Oh, I think you can picture it now. The Bryan Connerty at the settlement conference... he would've stormed out of here the moment I walked in. But you stayed, and you listened. Hmm. And like you said... I stare at the lions at the zoo, too. Doesn't mean I wanna be one. Sure, it does. Everyone wants to be a lion. Most people just never get the chance. I'm offering you one now. Thanks for the pizza. I didn't hear "no."

I thought your kind could only come in when invited. Look at what you did to this fucking place. I wonder what would've made you feel you needed to do this. But you do know we were never able to get a warrant to bug it. Oh, not having a warrant wouldn't stop you. Or maybe there is one buried in the ceiling somewhere. I can't... I can't really remember. What the<i> fuck</i> are you even doing here? I come bearing gifts. Open it. I want you to have that. - As a reminder. - I don't need a reminder. The memory of shoving that up your ass makes me laugh at least once a day. Yeah, I bet it does. But I'm not laughing. Oh, you should. The studies say that laughter does more to contribute to a general sense of well-being than almost anything else. Oh, yeah. No, of course. I love to laugh. I'm not laughing<i> now</i> is what I should've said. Oh, why is that? Because my wife kicked me out. Good for her! But she's not here either, if you're trying to find her. We've both lost her. Oh. Well, then maybe you have a sliver of my pain, because you stripped away everything that matters to me. <i>You</i> came at<i> me!</i> Because you're a criminal,<i> Bob.</i> And it's my job to shut 'em down and put 'em in jail. Well, if that's true, you're not very good at it. You're also full of shit. What have I done wrong? Really? Except make money, succeed. All these rules and regulations... arbitrary, chalked up by politicians for their own ends. And these fines you're always going after... Where do they go? Who gets them? The poor? No. The Treasury, the government. It's taxation by other means. Save the civics lesson and the Ayn Rand bullshit. The fines are the minimum of what you should have to pay. Oh, you decide what cases to take, and you only take the cases you won't lose. But you got it wrong with me, ...because this country... ...was built on industry and competition. So they will<i> always</i> have a place for me. Oh. And maybe a few generations from now, they'll tell stories about you, ...like they do Jesse James... ....or Billy the Kid. Oh, the myth is so fuckin' romantic. The rugged individual who won't back down to the unimaginative, do-gooder authorities. Only in reality, those guys stole and hurt and destroyed lives. Now you say you don't think you've harmed anyone. I say that the effect is the same, worse even, because you infect the entire world. You throw the whole system off balance, leaving chaos and poverty in your wake. I make the system run. I have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and philanthropy. I am employ hundreds of people directly, thousands indirectly. What do you do? Nothing... besides suck from the municipality, feed off of it. And in exchange, you what? Keep order? You're a traffic cop hiding in federal robes. I'm moved. I am... that is gonna play huge to the other guys ...on your cell block. Oh, you're sure to become President of the, uh, Libertarian Club of Danbury Federal Prison. 'Cause no matter what you say, that's where you're ending up. Keep that as a memento. And every time you look at it, know that deal is as good as it is ever gonna get for you. And one day, you are gonna wish like fucking hell that it was still on the table. Then you should've kept half of that for yourself, too. Because when I pull a deal off the table, I leave Nagasaki behind. You know the only enemy more dangerous than a man with unlimited resources... ...is one with nothing to lose. And that is what you are looking at right here.

 

 

 

 

 

Nice hit. I'm deciding whether or not to buy this team. They let me play. They're good boys. My skills are not like theirs but I make up for it with aggression. In my experience, that quality makes all the difference. In school, in bars, in the market, in prison... I was in. Now I'm out. I don't think about it. Unless it's brought up. Ah. If you say so. I don't think about my fight with my government either. If<i> you say so.</i> Look at us, couple of tough guys. World beaters. Yet, investors will have questions. How will you explain your troubles? Victim of class warfare. I win too much, game must be rigged. I have heard it said that every life is like a body of water with the equal amount of salt added. The key to enduring it, is to expand your body, to make your body so vast inside... that you don't even notice the salt. I say, who the fuck has time for that? I just decided to like the salt. However you get there, right? Survival, in this world, is<i> all.</i> Well, I know that better than anyone else on Wall Street... Look. Why don't you cancel all your other meetings around town with these candy-asses... Maybe I like to hear their strategies, to see what I could steal. Maybe I'm not convinced you've got your edge back. Or maybe I am, and I just want to see you work a little bit harder for it. No one works harder than me. Good. Our lieutenants should meet. Pick through the grains of rice... strategies, numbers. How we make ourselves richer. Stronger. Thick with power, like Vasily Alekseyev himself. Yes? Yes.

So, is that some piss running down your leg? I know you didn't like the strategy we pitched your guy. Pitching potato-powered cars and all that... fucking with my lieutenant. With me. Not so. Then you're scared. You don't want to do business with me. I wouldn't have invited you here if that were the case. You don't want to insult me personally. So you invite me over for the 'save meeting' in the hopes that I will end the conversation myself. So. Now. Answer: Is that some piss running down your leg? Fear isn't in this. In me. - I think you see that. - Why do you say that? Because you invite me over to the house where your children sleep? And this makes you tall and tough and proud? I'm a fucking businessman. And a real sweetheart. I'm Casper the Friendly Ghost. Yeah. So am I. And if you mention my kids like that again you'll find out just how fucking friendly. That was fun! And exciting. You know, I heard a story about an oligarch... maybe you know him, maybe you can tell me if it's true. He liked to hunt. But his idea of hunting was to hunker down in a heated cabin. He had people do the real work. They tracked the game, corralled it, gored it, and led it to a well lit area. And our guy, from the safety of his toasty perch, slid open the glass, took aim with his sniper rifle, and delivered the kill shot. Now, I know men who would say that's not sporting, and others who would say 'however you get there, right?' I would say it wasn't me. Wasn't real Russian either. Why go through the charade? If you want to kill the meat, kill the meat. If you only want to eat the meat, get someone else to do the killing. Makes sense to me. But I do my own. And I'm not afraid of the wet work either. In fact, I'll be your personal craft butcher. I respect this. So, now that you know I want your money, are you coming on board or not? I didn't survive my cell, and get<i> here,</i> to catch a hunter's bullet meant for you. Well, I guess we know now whose pants are soaking. No one's shooting at me anymore. And as for the government, I am hooked up on high. How high? Oh. You want a show of trust? I can do that. I can compel trust. I want a show of influence. So I'll do that thing, too.

Did it work? What? Sean Ayles told me you gave him a check for 250K for the Foundation. Right on the heels of selling your Maserati. So did it work? Did it make you feel better? Or less guilty anyway? Not Maserati better... I felt guilty once. About 16, 17 years back I thought: I should be understated, keep a low profile for my investors' sake. And what's so bad about First Class air travel? So, I'm sitting on the runway one night, waiting endlessly to take off. And an hour later, a blizzard closes the airport down. I blend right in with everybody else as we De-planed, tried to book motel rooms for the night. Bought my first Gulfstream the next day. Last time I let guilt win.

No conference room, no lawyers? I could get used to this. I had lawyer read, I don't have lawyer enforce. One rule before we go forward: you can't lose my money. No. Of course not. My every move is geared to make and not lose money... Mnh. No. You can't lose my money... If you do, we have problem. Understood? And so our adventure begins. True, very true... Happy occasion like this reminds me of funny story. Many years ago, I was walking along the Moskva Christmas market. You ever seen Moskva Christmas market? Always a sense of good cheer, even during the lean years. I think it was the wine. They serve warm wine with the spices in it. Cinnamon and... I was waiting on the line... everyone was always waiting on the line. And finally I got my cup, I turn, and there was this little boy. Runny nose. He... he's looking at me so desirous of my cup of this warm, warm wine that I give him a sip. He stares at me with such a gratitude. And then I notice his mother. Plump breasts... she must have known someone. So I give him my cup of wine. And I take his mother away from the square. Behind the soldiers. And after, I leave her <i>for the soldiers.</i> And I walked back, and this little boy is staring at me with his greedy drunken eyes. Do you know what happened to him? No. I always ask. No one ever knows.

Ohh! She says you have a real forehand. Do a thing, do it well. Your mother teach you that? The opposite, maybe. Thanks for setting this up. Listen, Axe, I'm pulling capital. All of it? 1.5 billion. Oh, that's almost half the investment. I got a good opportunity. Good for you. A Russian oil venture. What you would call a "mortal lock." Your money just landed. I put it in, I take it out. I shake it all about. You know I normally have a quarterly gate for people with new money. But as a courtesy to you I let you come in without that restriction. And I appreciate the courtesy. Now I must take advantage. What'd he say? To let you win next time. I told him that's never gonna happen. You're way too smart to believe that anyway. You got that right. Thanks. It was awesome. Wags, rally the team. We need to step up the timeline on the raise.

I thought we were making progress. When I'd heard you'd stood up to Dollar Bill. Me too! But it didn't last. I think the snap back made me even more timid, somehow. What happened today? You know we're looking for short term cash generators. <i>I have one.</i> I'd like to talk, um, to you later. I have, maybe, I might have an idea to generate alpha, quickly. Go! Here? This is where it all happens. Let fly. Now. I've... uh... been tracking rental car companies for years. Is this an automotive play? Because we're well covered in that space. It isn't. But there's a kernel of an idea that's grown... And? <i>But I couldn't pitch it.</i> And then, I couldn't even... go... Go? It's hard to concentrate with all of you watching right now. <i>Pee. I had pee fright.</i> Come on. Let's walk. We do assessments of everyone who works here. To see who might be a candidate for one of these offices. The C-suite offices? That's right. Most of the time it just confirms that most folks are exactly where they should be. They've topped out. Or worse, are going to bottom out. Is that what mine says? Would I have brought you up here if you were bottoming out? No...? Well, actually, I might. If I thought you needed a jolt. But this is not that. This is: right now, at this moment, if you want to finally live the fuck up to your potential instead of spiraling, you must find a way to shift the paradigm. That could be your office, or that. CIO, picking the strategies. COO, managing the risk. Eh... Maybe even... Owner? Yes, instead of being down there, with them. But that's where I'm comfortable. No. It's where you've made yourself fit. Because you're so bound up in being the smallest, most helpful, unobtrusive version of yourself. Just like your mother shits on your head for. Now, what you need to do to prove her wrong, and prove it to yourself, is something totally out of character, big and bold. Something public, that terrifies you, in order to free yourself. Like... recite a sonnet to a crowd. Invite the office to see you skydive. Become a Toastmaster. Something totally out of character. You have to break through the confidence barrier, because then... you'll break through the C-suite barrier, too.

My children. You'll notice they don't whine. You've trained them well. Credit these women with that... my wife, my ex, my mother, but no. The kids came out that way. We were lucky. Also, not American, which when it comes to whining, really fucking helps. That it does. But you trained yourself though. I took from you. You didn't make a squeal or spill a tear. Very un-American. Would it have worked? Only to make me never think of you again. And somehow like the<i> man,</i> Teófilo Stevenson, you boxed your way out of the corner and found a way to cover your losses. Well, what were the choices? Exactly as I'd see it. In the end, I decided not to make the oil deal. For you? No. Eh, maybe a little bit. But now I put the money back. Along with a promise to give you a warning before I pull it again. Best I could hope for. I know you must've broken things... people, deals, someone's hopes and dreams... in order to get money back into your firm. But you swallow it, here, now, because this is business and life and who cares what it costs you? Indeed. I tell you... you must always have a three year old in your house, to make you appreciate life... And you must also have your mother close. To keep the line unbroken. There is plenty I would kill for, you know, if we're being honest. And there's no reason not to be. But family, Axe, I would do things for these people that you couldn't imagine. As they have all done for me. Especially her, my dear mama. You're the boy. Aren't you? In your story. Who took the wine from the stranger? If that were true, what would you be saying about my mother? That she did what she had to do to protect her family. And you. And didn't complain. I am fortunate to have her. You are a fortunate man, Grigor. We are both so. And fortunate to have met when we did.

Grigor. We must meet. Now. Nice place. Yeah. Once I own every townhouse on the block, I'll put them all together. Make a real<i> home,</i> you know? Quilts on the beds, needlepoints on the walls, healing crystals in every window. Until then, this one is a place for special conversations. They can hear it? They hear everything, but they know exactly what happens when someone speaks out of turn. As, I imagine, your man does. I do. So, you know you have a problem, yes? Yes. Because you don't have pest control. So the pests are running all around the place with no consequences. But I'm very good at dealing with pests, with vermin. I have a perfect score with Consumer Reports. So if I promise you that I will make your problem disappear, your problem will never, ever return. I can't allow Mr. Axelrod... Shut the fuck up! I understand what you're offering. But I cannot ask you to do it, at this time. If it were me and I were standing as naked as Paris Hilton and twice as fucked, I would not hesitate. I know you wouldn't. And that perhaps it's what's called for. So, then, you want me to do it? You have to say it. I have to hear you. Why are you willing to do this for me? Look at this from my particular set of binoculars. I gave you my assets. At least in part because Taylor was going to help manage them. So when they fucked you over. They fucked me over, too. But I ask your permission because, really, she is your property. Not mine. Well, I'm grateful for your loyalty. My loyalties are clear. Can I respond by tomorrow? Sure. Shame about Taylor. So smart. Loss for everyone. You seemed to take that seriously. Damn right. When I've suggested such actions in the past, you never even considered it. Well, once a guy like that puts it on the table, you have to think about what happens if you say no as much as if you say yes. If you decide on something this final, it shouldn't be farmed out, it should be done in-house. Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. Look, I need to think about what other options I have. And how to protect myself no matter which choice I make. And I need to look Taylor in the eye. Shit, Axe, look, it was time for a change. I'm sure you thought so too. I want to thank you, of course. Figured I would when the dust settled... Shut the fuck up, Mafee. You did what you did, you got your money, but no amount I give to charity will help me atone for the ass fucking I will give you in this business. You hearing me? Now go get your new fucking master. The palace coup is complete. Today you settled all family business. I get that you're angry. But I think it's because I left before you could finish me off. You think I was acting against you? The undercutting, the manipulation, and public, and private, humiliation. The lies and broken promises. All while I good soldiered it and made you money. But how long, really, was it going to be before you sent me off to slaughter? Wrong. I wasn't getting rid of you or working against you. You were on the inside. We were succeeding together. I trusted you in a way that I almost never trust anyone. It may have seemed unorthodox, but that's the truth of it. And now you've taken from me. You've stolen from me, under false pretenses. And you've betrayed me. I did what I had to do to survive. And to win. You've got to understand that. I did it for me, not against you. Sure. Right. Congratulations, now you have your own shop, billions under management. You're moving even quicker than I did. Yes. I'll surpass your assets under management, at the rate I calculate, in three years at the earliest, eight at the latest. Maybe. You're ready for the summit. But you know what they call that spot up on Everest? The Death Zone. Some people that make it up, and then they make it back home. But there are countless more, fucking dead, encased in ice for all time. That's where you are now. And very few people can even survive on the available oxygen up here. Even fewer can perform. So we'll see. Young lungs. So yeah, we will. You know your history, so you know what happens to usurpers. Charles Edward Stuart, for example. Bonnie Prince Charlie. Yes. His troops slaughtered. Him exiled from the kingdom... More like on the run for the rest of his life. And that was one of the more civilized responses. You<i> have</i> to know that anything I do to stop you is warranted. I anticipated that being your reaction. So do what you must. And I'll defend as I have to.

So, have you come to a decision?</i> I'm gonna pass on your offer. I didn't have you as a squeamish man. A little delicate, maybe, on the outside. But I thought you were a man like me. A man with steel in all the places one needs it. Maybe we just need it in different spots. Ah. So you're beyond this sort of thing, then. Or you could say this: I was raised in a place that didn't require these extraordinary measures. You weren't. If you don't want to tell me to do it, but want it to happen anyway, that's fine. No. I don't. Fine. Okay... Then I will pull all my money, and I will give it to Taylor. I promised I would give you a warning... This is it. Look, nothing in the way I operate my business has changed. You loved it last week. How can I keep my money with a man who won't kill for it? I don't want Taylor dead. I want them alive to experience all that I am gonna do to them. I'm gonna destroy them in ways that'll make them wish they got what you offered. Sure. Why not? Have fun. But remember, if what you do to them, costs me, we will meet again. Until then, goodbye, Axe.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

<i>Sir? Excuse me!</i> We know you've been siphoning from athletic donations to give scholarships to Syrian refugees. Your board's not gonna like that... Yeah. And I'm certain the authorities won't either. Is this your plan? To blackmail me? Blackmail? Nah. The word is expose. Expose what? I'm helping smart kids and their families... people with next to nothing... make it in this world. And I think you'll find a school community here that supports that. Mm. Sounds noble, but will they, really? You clearly underestimate the empathy of the Skinner family. These are your so-called "scholarship recipients..." But what it really looks like is cheap labor. Yeah. They... They have no accommodations when they get here, so I take them in. They help around the house. That's it. Unpaid illegal immigrants living in your house. That's not a very good look, Headmaster. Well, I don't care what it looks like. I'm helping these people. Well, it looks like 'these people' are working for you. And they aren't getting paid for it, are they? - Don't they call that white slavery? - I think they just call it slavery... This isn't right. Are you really going to destroy me... tarnish this historic institution that's helped thousands of young men and women and those poor refugees... to keep your son from being expelled? Bet your ass I am. In fact I have. - Isn't that what I just did, Wags? - Yeah. I saw you do it. - Like three seconds ago. - Hmm. So. You are going to clear my son, Gordie, of any wrongdoing. But that's not it. Oh. We're not finished. Not by a long shot. 'Cause you embarrassed him... dragged him in here, held him out in front of the school like a common criminal. You dinged his reputation. So now you are going to give me the chance to fix that, too. Your headmaster was kind enough to cede me the mic for this morning's lesson, and I'm here to give you a little bit about what this school has been holding back from you... the goddamn truth about Darwin, scarcity and the world you actually live in. It's not the warm, swaddled place your Headmaster and your parents have told you about. It's populated by people like me who will TEAR YOU APART. Nature didn't select me. I selected myself by harnessing my nature. My son wasn't pulling a prank. He was trying to earn. And if he broke the school's code, it's because the code is wrong. Asked him to go against the DNA which is telling each of you to be greedy, yes, be hungry. Subjugate and conquer. 'Cause that's who we are. That's what we are. Capitalism harnesses that better than any other economic model on Earth. Everything we have is because of capitalism. 'Cause someone had an incentive to get up off his ass, to out-invent, to out-earn, yes, and to subjugate others less capable, less intelligent, less ambitious, less lucky... to make those capitalistic dreams come true. And you know what I'm talking about, Headmaster Kessel. It's the dirty secret you may not want to hear... but you fucking love the result. As will you soon enough.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're gonna walk into his office and we're gonna let the Headmaster know what we know about him, and then you... ...will be sleeping back in your dorm room tonight, Gord... Oh. Glad I caught you. Just had a one-on-one with Skinner's athletic director. Amiable man, after a fashion. He confirmed Kessel took the money? Yes... and no. Pinched it but didn't pocket it. Redirected it. He's actually working for the good. Like Robin of fucking Locksley? Much like that. Um, Kessel sidetracked the excess money from wrestling to fund a scholarship program for Syrian refugees that the school had refused to fund. Three of those refugees and their families are on campus this year. I'll stand by. So the headmaster, sanctimonious though he sure is, turns out is a good man after all. So, do we still have to destroy him? What do you think? Such a father. Hey. Still haven't caught up with your eldest? My Georgie? No, I haven't. Last I heard, he ran a legal cannabis business in Colorado... but it crossed state lines. Now, much like the answer, he's blowing in the wind. Don't beat yourself up on this, Wags. Fathering ain't easy. Hey. <i>I have what I need to take this Headmaster out.</i> Do I fix this for him? How do I not fuck my kid up more? <i>That's the question</i> every decent parent asks every day. Let's say you take the laissez-faire approach, let the market have its way with Gordie. He learns there are consequences. Gets suspended, probably expelled. Ends up at a lower-tier prep school or New York Military Academy. Goes to Colby instead of Harvard. There's... There's no shame in that... I mean, unless for the kid who's going mini-Winklevoss at 14... it's what he set his sights on. <i>Then it's crushing.</i> <i>And maybe he blames you for the consequence.</i> <i>And that chip on his shoulder</i> <i>turns into a drinking problem by the time he's 28.</i> <i>Or he blames himself,</i> <i>accepts the consequences,</i> <i>self-worth gets dinged up pretty good...</i> And winds up with a drinking problem by the time he's 28. And then there's you... Can you stay the course... with whatever you decide? Because if you dive in after him only sometimes, he won't know how or when to swim, or breathe, or trust. It's got to be tough love all the way... which could work out great, he could turn out great... or the interventionist approach forevermore. So the question is, do I have the stomach to let him dangle?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm leaning heavily toward expulsion. Yeah. Lean too far, you might could fall. I'm no band leader. Last guy who said that lost his prized equine. It might seem like a tough lesson. But no matter how hard you try... I will not allow you to put a price on Gordie's soul. Good day. Am I punished? I don't know what I'm doing with you. First, let's get you clear of it. Tell me we got something good on this prig? Bad news. The Headmaster, Kessel, is clean. This is a man with no discernible vices. No arrests, no legal battles, no financial problems. Not even a DUI. I mean who doesn't have a single DUI on their record... I digress. Fuck this place... - Wait, I like it here... - Thacker Prep. Beech Abbey School. Eaglestone. All fine, fine institutions... Those are rehabs and reform schools. And all brief resting places for me in my youth. I was going to offer to make a call. Gordie's not tumbling down the fucking ladder, he's staying here. Look. If we can't squeeze the Headmaster, then we squeeze what he loves most: the school. And we squeeze him where it's most tender: the donors. I'll call Hall. - Dad, I'm really sorry. - Hey. Hey. Of course I defend you in front of the Headmaster... never speak against the family... but between us, you really fucked up. The risk/reward ratio is off. And there are better ways to impress a girl... than putting your whole future at stake. Look. I'm not mad that you ran a scheme, I'm mad you didn't game it out. Second law of thermodynamics, Gordie... Total entropy of a system... No. The price of your actions. Now we have to ruin a headmaster. - A good man. - What a show of parentage. I have so much to learn from you both, about communication between a father and a son. Hall, we have a job for you, breaking down a prep school like a butcher quartering a spring lamb. I'll get to that in a minute. But first, I have a job for you.

This was my favorite place in the house. Even though it's not technically in the house. Yeah. I come out here most every day, too. Even in the winter. My mom's worried I'll catch pneumonia. But I still do it. Yep. Mine didn't like it either. \[Axe\] At night I'd even sneak out here after she went to bed. And just breathe. Inside that house... eh, for me, this was better. - Yeah. I like it at night. - \[car door closes\] Til I can hardly see the hoop.

Hey, Randy, I was just telling Savion how I used to come out here as a kid growing up in Yonkers. You mind if I... No. Not at all. Go on ahead. \[cellphone chimes\] You know, this was a rough neighborhood even back then. No one really had any money at all. \[Axe\] Snowy mornings, I'd come out here, shovel the driveway, and then I'd stand here and I'd look at other people digging themselves out. Eventually the plows would come through, but only after they had already been to the rich neighborhoods. Same thing now. \[Savion\] They don't give much of a shit for us. \[Axe\] Yeah. Last streets plowed, man. If people wanted to go to work, they had to get out here with a shovel. I saw that as an advantage. Started up my first business. You know? Did all the shoveling myself. Then I hired some friends. Then I expanded to other neighborhoods. And I took the money I earned. I invested it in other ideas. That's how I started, man.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Huh. Sneak attack. Mediation. Alright, well, let me get ahead of it by apologizing, so I can start my day. I'm sorry, Taylor... that you're in snowflake mode... - Snowflake? - And that your save-the-Earth play led me to a bigger score with good old rock oil. Well, Mr. Plainview, you didn't offend my delicate sensibilities. What you did do was fuck up the bigger score. - Is that right? - \[Taylor\] Yes, it is. This is a list of colleges and universities with endowments that were ripe for divestment. This first wave had a potential haul of 8.8 billion. All un-gettable now, since the pitch is ruined because you made us look like greedy, opportunistic hypocrites. Projections on potential assets are always overly optimistic. Listen: This comes down to poor communication. And a lack of alignment, for which you're both to blame. Taylor, you should have trusted him and told him the entire play. He cracked out of turn and moved aggressively, and in this case... Bobby, that was in error. But by holding out, Taylor, you're just as responsible. You know, perception and optics are at all-time importance levels in our business and in life. And a unified team is a much more powerful image than either of you individually. Quant and fundamental. Impact and traditional... the best of both worlds. The question is: What are we gonna do about it now? ♪ Dramatic music ♪ ...what if we played it as an activist move... - Yes. - \[Axe\] Hmm. Push the companies to clean up, to put in the kind of initiatives the schools will be impressed by. Sell it as policing from the inside. Which will allow us to sell divestment to more institutions. I should do it. My reputation... - Agreed. - I'll go talk with Argyra and Charter Offshore. You practically dressed me down in front of a junior. I need to maintain a shred of credibility. We both know you missed it. I was trying to broker the least embarrassing version.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yeah. But we can't give in to feeling good in the moment. We have to win.
