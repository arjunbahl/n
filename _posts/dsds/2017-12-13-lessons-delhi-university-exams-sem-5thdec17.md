1. Practice in tense situations, keeping yourself tested for tense situations. What i felt today was that i get conscious during exams due to which i make silly mistakes, rather i should be tense free so that i can write exam openly. It's the same case as in Skating, where i competed in Nationals(Virar, etc.) with tensions but later on upon running skating through relay i had no worries, no tensions, ran freely with open mind and relaxed mind and gave far better(50%) better performance.
2. Practice with dedication, discipline well before exams, don't be casual. You get casual about certain challenges and goals or plans, refer earlier entries in blog as well wherever pointed. Get it through your head, its far more important and imperative to "do" than to "plan" or "strategize". Gary Vaynerchuk said.
3. You need to get control of your mind, practice meditation-yoga daily. Get control of yourself, develop discipline similar to earlier days during skating.

Mistakes repeated more than once aren't mistakes, they are decisions.

Look upto your Role Models, Goals, Plans, where you want to be and then "execute", shoot!
