How do you hope to manage a company when you cannot manage yourself?

Your objective is to manage people, companies, money but how will you be able to do so if you can't manage yourself.

If you don't have control over yourself how will you be able to exercise it over others?

Align your actions with your objectives, goals.

Use the advantage of time to train and enhance yourself on the path towards your goal/objective.

Time is limited, once gone it can't be created again, use it to train yourself not only for adding knowledge-skills but also for self-improvement either mentally or physically.

Learn how to manage things, people and you. Perform actions as per priorities. Use baniya mindset to get most out of limited time. For instance if you have to study for IPCC alongwith college, manage it, use free time(Metro, early morning, etc.). You must learn to manage yourself, its a skill that takes time to master it. Start right now to master it.
