Whenever you are stuck with low motivation, emotions against doing something do not give up instantly, instead tell your "other mind- the lazy one" to do it for a "marginally" more time. And suddenly your "other mind" will get in parallel with the "smart mind" and now you won't be feeling non-motivated or stressed out.

This is what you used to practice while skating training sessions, just telling your mind to continue the strenuous activity for "marginally" more time. "Another 2 laps and then i'll stop" or "1 more minute and then i'll take a short rest" and soon after you were motivated well enough to run 3 more laps or workout 10 more minutes..

It's just to spark up the engine to continue for a little longer, to sustain a little longer and then you feel motivated again and then it turns out you are convinced to beat yourself at it, you can take it longer. The distraction or the unnecessary emotions(non motivating ones) are gone.

This works because you essentially made it "easier" than before and "definite" process, well planned with clear goals out there. After reducing the goal to a minuscule goal you think you can achieve it and therefore your mind(the lazy one) cooperates with the counterpart.

This happens because you lose patience or you are too stressed out, lost sight of will power, your true potential, motivation, etc.

When there are unwanted feelings or emotions don't let them evolve, take your mind off within first 5 seconds because once you're into the spiral the more you wait the more hard it is to get out. For instance, while studying you suddenly have the urge to watch TV or switch up to Youtube, dont flow down the spiral and be fooled by your "lazy mind", instead just "let go of " this emotion/feeling within first 5-7 seconds before it's too late. This is applicable for transforming any "potential switch" to moods, emotions, feelings. Feeling unhappy, starting to get the realization? It's just an emotion, may not be real at all, infact your surrounding and situation is totally neutral these are just the brain chemicals, just "let go"/ "ignore" the feeling and just after 5 seconds of ignoring it the feeling will be gone.

However the above works only when we are aware of "what we want" and "this is a wastage of time" elements.
