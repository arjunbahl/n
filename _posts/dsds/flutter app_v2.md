To be good, be self-disciplined. To be excellent, love what you do. To be the best, be obsessed. stress/tension manage, test of your endurance- lose friends| relations| no food, no trying go all the way

Special Forces: Your Choice (let's say you're greedy and love to eat sweets in front of you, its now your choice whether to eat in balance proportion or eat excessively and become a bum), SF is a state of mind- leave us in jungle with no clothes we'll come back, surrounded us we'll hit them and make it back, Fuckin put a bullet into his head, Let go- hang on a thread- on the edge, calm in chaos, train to live under pressure-probation for life, constant choice and pressure under which we work, Nothing is impossible, nothing, nothing, nothing, machine gun firing ambush-hiding in the nala between mountains- whole column- the man who stands now and returns fire and gives shit back is the natural leader-bhoot bana diya saalo ka-you have to take it no one gonna give you

3 levels of consciousness: follower, leader and, an explorer

i just thought at that point of time that the man who stands now and returns fire he's the leader

Special forces- lead uncomfortable life, be comfortable with uncomfortable circumstances

certain kind of people who are at that consciousness level where they understand that the choice is theirs those are the kind of people we look for

we want the guys who can make the ultimate choice because they made it and they can stick by it even if you know yamaraja comes and stands in front of you'll tell a fucking put a bullet in you man get the fuck out of my way

what is there beyond when you give up when you when you just let it all go and you're hanging by that thread of choice because it's a choice you made so you're hanging by the thread of choice constantly there constantly there and when you when that choice is so strong and you remain there that's what we are looking for self uh an ability to make a choice for yourself and stick by it so that's what filters out in combat you know that's what we want in combat

Kohli: i try but woh agr khatm hogaya In the last 10 years have you ever woken up not feeling 150% passionate cause I believe you wake up feeling 150% passionate every day when you go to play. – Everyone has off days. – Ive woken up feeling a sense of detachment from what Im doing. Thinking that I dont want to do this. But that has been because of excessive pressure thats been on me during a difficult phase. But still, Ive had the ability to still tell myself no. I’ll go out and try once morehe day you lose the will to go out and try once more then you can’t do anything and No one can convince youo chance. So what is the motivation? Motivation is just about winning. The day I lose my passion, I’ll stop playing.

David Goggins- The sympathetic nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. mornings when going on a run is the last thing you want to do, but then twenty minutes into it you feel energized, that’s the work of the sympathetic nervous system. Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. 



Someone who has an edge: "I look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed, and logs onto a poker site so that he can pick off the U.S. drunks coming home on Saturday night. I hired a guy like that. He usually clears 5 or 10 grand every Sunday morning before breakfast taking out the drunks playing poker because they're not very good at it, but their confidence has gone up a lot." - Michael Platt, Bluecrest

Shyness harmed the social interactions of people with the fixed mindset but did not harm the social relations of people with the growth mindset. The fixed mindset makes you concerned about judgment, and this can make you more self-conscious and anxious. The observers’ ratings showed that, although both fixed- and growth-minded shy people looked very nervous for the first five minutes of the interaction, after that the shy growth-minded people showed greater social skills, were more likable, and created a more enjoyable interaction. In fact, they began to look just like non-shy people.
- George was incredibly shy, especially with women. He was so eager to look cool, witty, and confident—and so worried that he’d look overeager and inept—that he froze and acted cold. When his attractive co-worker Jean started flirting with him, he became so flustered that he began avoiding her. Then one day she approached him in a nearby coffee shop and cutely suggested he ask her to join him. When he couldn’t think of a clever response to impress her, he replied, “It doesn’t matter to me if you sit down or not.”
- George, what were you doing? He was trying to protect himself from rejection—by trying not to seem too interested. And he was trying to end this awkward situation. In a strange way, he succeeded. He certainly didn’t seem too interested, and the interaction soon ended, as Jean got out of there real fast. He was just like the people in Jennifer Beer’s study, controlled by his fear of social judgment and prevented from making contact.

- Wetzler slowly helped George get over his exclusive focus on being judged. Jean, he came to see, was not out to judge and humiliate him, but was trying to get to know him. With the focus switched from being judged to developing a relationship, George was eventually able to reciprocate. Despite his anxiety, he approached Jean, apologized for his rude behavior, and asked her to lunch. She accepted. What’s more, she was not nearly as critical as he feared.
