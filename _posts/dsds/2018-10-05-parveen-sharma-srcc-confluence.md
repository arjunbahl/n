- Start your own practice-business, not essesntially into tax-audit compliance but fields where no one goes.
- Oppurtunites exist outside CA conventional fields(Compliance practice- Audit, Law, Tax they do have saturation)
- True that conventional fields of practice are saturated.
- Took example of IBA(International Business Advisors), in 2003 2 young CA thought whether to continue as Deloitte employees or start their own business after gaining good exposure from it, they worked on outsourcing and provided platform to foreign companies to start in India.
- Problem ke solution dhundo, where problem lies oppurtunity exists. Organisations mein jaao, problems dhundo aur unka solution dhundo, better organisation apni banao.
- Took example of IIFL, a CA founder venturing into Wealth Management since he had interest in Finance.
- By 35 you should have your own business, creating value for your own entity.
