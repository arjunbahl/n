Being in uncomfortable situations builds one's character, for instance after rigorous practice sessions of skating i developed a "never quit" attitude, that anything is possible, an attitude of "lasting a little longer", being competitive, being disciplined and serious about goals and plans, while on the other hand Jiju or Aastha who have led relatively "comfortable and less challenging" life may not have this. After leaving skating i had a stint with too much comfort, not pushing myself during 11th and suddenly i wasn't ranked 1st in class(Amit was) or wasn't disciplined at all, later during IPCC preparations where i pushed myself i became more serious about life and eventually got more disciplined about it, used to get up early, planning things out, sticking to a plan,etc. was inculcated. This was because of this uncomfortable situation i was in that i had to "force" myself to work up to relevant levels. Just like all successful people(my role models as well) all went through "pushing themselves" into uncomfortable situations and taking hard decisions, being more disciplined, think of Abel or William Kane, or Harvey Specter, or Virat Kohli, etc. they all did go through it. That's how compounding works out to help you being successful, initially its "hard" but as we descend benefits > efforts(hard work) put in. Being in uncomfortable situations develops our character and values, which is transcended later into life situations. So always push yourself into uncomfortable situations to enhance yourself, even if you fail you'll learn something and zeal to overcome that failure will be increased.
