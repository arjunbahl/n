1. Solve problems by finding that one constant that doesn't change, this concept is known as Invariance.
2. You can find this by "playing around with the problem" and see what changes and what doesn't.
3. Then you build you further solution on this invariant as you've successfully narrowed down possibilities.
4. Do this iteratively.
