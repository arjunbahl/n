GST exam, college, didn't take subject seriously, wasted time on laptop before exams had begun as well as during exam time, wasted time on low priority things like Stock market at the time, could've been postponed, should've looked up practical problems from book and 10yrs, practiced less at the end and during college time. Time management and discipline lacking.
