Things are to be done, after considering their priorities, whether now or later, else you sacrifice on your future success.

Things due, as per priorities, if done now are easier as compared to doing them later.

The work required, efforts to be made compounds over time, hence the more you wait the harder performing/completing the task becomes, "real" worth of time just like "real" value of money falls, hence "worth" of time gets discounted, i.e. you are able to perform less of that activity later as compared to today.
