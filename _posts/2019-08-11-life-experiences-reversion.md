Mean Reversion in life experiences. I so worked up this last week, worked on whole weekends with Himanshu for GST seminar PPT, worked all the way late into nights, stayed up there and worked, came home late and yet stayed awake to finish things off. Found fraud of 320cr, got it verified by Mukul and yet it wasn't added to PPT, after getting all the shit done and working my ass off i with the hope of accompanying Himanshu to Bhopal for Seminar to IRS officers Mukul was chosen to accompnay him instead of me. Meanwhile also had to handle Canara stuff, reached home late throughout the week and working even after reaching late into night. Being such a stressed week that i had no time to think for myself which i realised this weekend. The late Thursday evening where i made many mistakes in front of Himanshu humiliated myself infront of them. felt like shit that night. I didn't have a single moment for myself throughout this week. And then it got paid off, i got a text from Musckaan today that she's back in India, as against earlier notion when she said she'll be back next year. All that hardwork, struggle and the shit week i sliced through, the down side in life has paid off. So slog through struggles and uncomfortable experiences in life, push yourself through them. Take on such bad experiences, the more such experiences the more good ones follow. Hustle through them!

 

I learnt to be confident, as if you own the goddamn place and people there. Always be all in. Be proactive and don't slouch around.

 

"What is interesting about being alive is that you are all in. No matter what you do, you are all in. This is gonna kill you. So you might as well play the most magnificent game you can. Do you have anything better to do?"

Always be confident even when you know you're wrong, don't hesitate when you're concerned what others think, be besharam in that case.
