1. Always re frame and insult, misinterpret.
2. Frame control, always find that winning frame, for instance Harvey completely changes the frame when he finds one, same goes for Frank Underwood.
3. Comebacks are better when you either reframe like Harvey or try something new.
4. ![](http://i0.wp.com/aakashkathuria.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screenshot_2017-03-28-21-09-35-1.png?w=528)
5. Never reply or clarify any insult made on you, roll with punch or reframe and re evaluate. Change the scene by adding completely new.
6. _Indirect insults=sarcasm + insult_
7. The shorter the better.
8. Witty replies, reframing.
