## Moral Exclusion
He is Osama, and as such, to borrow an expression from Ervin Staub in The Roots of Evil, he has been completely “excluded from our moral universe.” The interventions of conscience no longer apply to him. He is not human. He is an it. 


## Authority
- 6/10 people would follow authority without any concern for their own conscience/logic.
- Education and Knowledge can alleviate

1. Milgram's initial study, one of the minority of people who eventually refused to continue with the experiment was a thirty-two-year-old engineer who apparently regarded the scientist in the lab coat as, at most, his intellectual peer. This subject pushed his chair away from the shock generator and in an indignant tone said to Milgram, “I'm an electrical engineer, and I have had shocks . . . I think I've gone too far already, probably.” In an interview later, when Milgram asked him who was accountable for shocking the man in the other room, he did not assign any responsibility to the experimenter. Instead, he replied, “I would put it on myself entirely.” 

2. Milgram posed an “ordinary man,” rather than a scientist, as the person who ordered the subjects to administer shocks. When an “ordinary man” was in charge, instead of a man in a white lab coat, obedience on the part of the subjects dropped from 62.5 percent to 20 percent.

3. With education and knowledge, the individual may be able to hold on to the perception of him- or herself as a legitimate authority.

4. When Milgram varied his experiment such that he was not in the room, obedience dropped by two-thirds, to about the same level as when an “ordinary man” was in charge. And when authority was not close by, subjects tended to “cheat” by using only the lower 


## Deceit
- One lie, one broken promise, or a single neglected responsibility may be a misunderstanding instead. Two may involve a serious mistake. But three lies says you're dealing with a liar, and deceit is the linchpin of conscienceless behavior. Cut your losses and get out as soon as you can. Leaving, though it may be hard, will be easier now than later, and less costly.


## Respect/ Politeness in social situations
- Respect should be reserved for the kind and the morally courageous. Pity is another socially valuable response, and it should be reserved for innocent people who are in genuine pain or who have fallen on misfortune. If, instead, you find yourself often pitying someone who consistently hurts you or other people, and who actively campaigns for your sympathy, the chances are close to 100 percent that you are dealing with a sociopath.

- Related to this—I recommend that you severely challenge your need to be polite in absolutely all situations. For normal adults in our culture, being what we think of as “civilized” is like a reflex, and often we find ourselves being  automatically decorous even when someone has enraged us, repeatedly lied to us, or figuratively stabbed us in the back. Sociopaths take huge advantage of this automatic courtesy in exploitive situations. 
- Do not be afraid to be unsmiling and calmly to the point.




## Happiness
- William Damon write, “A positivity that includes optimism, love, and joy is . . . closely linked with morality, as we see in the lives of our exemplars.” Buddha again agrees. He says, “To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue.”

- Buddha put it this way: "“All that we are is the result of what we have thought. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.”"

- “Do not do to others what you would not want done to you"

- Picture clearly the face of someone you love more than all of your earthly possessions, someone for whom you would run headlong into a burning building if this were required of you—a parent, a brother, a sister, a dear friend, your life partner, your child. Try to picture that same face a parent's, or a daughter's, or a son's—weeping in grief, or smiling in peace and joy.

- ### Sociopaths
    - Sadly, this same self-limiting factor tends to apply even to sociopaths who are born with special gifts and talents. The kind of intense commitment and daily work required to develop and promote one's art, one's music, or any other creative project is typically impossible for a sociopath

    - Freud observed that an overactive superego could bully its owner into depression and possibly even suicide.
    
    - The first mistake is the desire to be personally in control of others and of the world. This motivation involves the illusion that domination is a worthwhile goal, an illusion that is most fixed in the sociopathic mind. And the second tragic error is moral exclusion.
