Yoga: Alignment Get things in life aligned and you'll be more efficient and effective, just like a Pit Crew in F1 where it seems so smooth and effortless or same geos for business processes like that of OYO. Find balance in all things in life, then stress is least just like in Yoga, when you're in a balanced position you can sustain there stress free.

Don't serve market rather create market.

Going global needs specialization

Don't sell give people a reason to buy, hence differentiation.

Homeopathy: There's exogenous and endogenous factors, for instance his son likes to spend his vacataion time at a beach and he noticed while his son and and wife didn't get sunburnt he did, so he wondered the exogenous factor(Sun) is present for all( his wife and his son and him) but they didn't get sunburnt while he did, why was this so, or same analogy goes for Pune where Swine Flue was spreading rapidly, he proposed its not the external factors(Sun, Swine Flu) rather endogenous factors(Our Immune System) which should be paid attention to and taken care of immensely.
