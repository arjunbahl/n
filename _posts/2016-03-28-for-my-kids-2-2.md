Opportunities are like buses when one leaves another arrives. Never feel disheartened when you lose some opportunity, everything happens for a reason. Back in the fall of my 10th standard, after being state champion consecutively for 3 times and then bagging 2 golds, 1 silver, 1 bronze, I wasÂ  a New Kid In Town. But soon on returning back I decided to quit it. Back then I felt I gave away an opportunity with my bare hands. I would question myself at times not believing why I had taken such a decision, am I losing something big? You see I was and am an extremely competitive person. Being skeptical about my decision was very fearing, but this decision was directly from my soul, no one's interference was present and I stood about it. And now I feel it was one of the best decisions I had taken for grabbing better opportunities. I had to derail my life's path in order to build a new one. As they say in order to build something new you gotta destroy it first. And "Kahin pahonchne ke liye kahain se nikal na bahot zaroori hai"

So whatever you decide, don't decide under any external interference. And if it's within you just believe in yourself.
