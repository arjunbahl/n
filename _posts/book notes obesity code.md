1. Calorie in calorie out are interlinked
    - body goes into homeostasis(heart rate drops, etc.) when calorie intake reduced
    - body starts burning excess energy when feeded
    - Body adjusts calorie expenditure 
    - Proximate cause vs Ultimate cause $\Longrightarrow$ Correlation vs Causation
2. Exercise
    - Exercise has little correlation with weight loss
    - same CICO methodology applies

3. Hormones
    - Insulin has strong causal link with weight gain
    - High insulin $\Longrightarrow$ Weight Gain
4. Insulin is the main culprit
    - Insulin regulates glucose in bloodstream. Directs cell to absorb glucose/sugar and store as fat/glucogen.
    - $\uarr$ Insulin $\longrightarrow$ leads to $\uarr$ Fat
    - Persistent high Insulin levels $\longrightarrow$ Insulin resistance $\Longrightarrow$ The Fat get fatter.
    - Reduce prolonged periods of Insulin, shorter and less frequent Insulin upticks(Insulin are like bursts) best
    - Gets secreted everytime we eat any type(any macro-protien,fats, carbs). Hence high protein diet(low fat- low carbs) has not worked in weight loss
    - Fatty foods can also stimulate insulin, but pure fats, such as olive oil do not stimulate insulin or glucose.
    - While vegetable proteins raise insulin minimally, whey protein and meat (including seafood) cause significant insulin secretion. 
5. Cortisol
    - Stress hormone, converts fat/stored energy into glucose upon stressor catalysts.
    - $\uarr$ Glucose $\longrightarrow$ leads to $\uarr$ Insulin
    - Since cortisol does opposite of Insulin(converting fat/glycogen) back to glucose overtime Insulin resistance builds up $\longrightarrow$ higher Insulin levels.
    - Reducing stress is vitally important. Sitting in front of the television or computer is a poor way to relieve stress. - Instead, stress relief is an active process. There are many time-tested methods of stress relief, including mindfulness meditation, yoga, massage therapy and exercise. 

6. Are Carbohydrates bad then?
    - No
    - Unprocessed carbohydrates have no link with increased Insulin levels.
    - In 1989, Dr. Staffan Lindeberg studied the residents of Kitava, one of the Trobriand Islands in Papua New Guinea’s archipelago—one of the last places on Earth where people ate a largely traditional diet. 
    - 69% of calories were from carbohydrates, and less than 1% from processed foods. Despite this high carbohydrate intake, insulin was very low among the Kitavans, resulting in virtually no obesity. 
    - Comparing the Kitavans to his native Swedish population, Dr. Lindeberg found that despite a diet that was 70% carbohydrate (unrefined), the Kitavans had insulin levels below the 5th percentile of the Swedes.
    - The average Kitavan native had an insulin level lower than 95% of Swedes.
    - Similarly, natives of the Japanese island of Okinawa eat a diet that is nearly 85% unrefined carbohydrates. 
    - They eat three times as many green and yellow vegetables, but only 25% of the sugar consumed by residents of nearby Japan. 
    - “Good” carbohydrates (whole fruits and vegetables) are substantially different from “bad” (sugar and flour). 

7. Fructose: Evil [1](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-fructose-bad-for-you-200705012507)
    - Fructose only processed by liver unlike glucose which cells can take up readily.
    - Leads to higher Insulin resistance 

8. Replace rather than add "weight loss inducing food"
    - Replace refined carbs and sugar with Fibre.
    - Fibre is "subtractor" than just "filler" as it slow down food absorption(low glucose levels)
    - Earlier times 70-120gm per day consumed, today ~15gm.

9. Vinegar
    - Ability to reduce Insulin resistance
    - Apple cider vinegar


10. Good diet
    - Cut down "added sugar" in soda, candies, etc.
    - Quinoa, Chia seeds, Wine
    - Replace desserts with nuts, cheese, milk, etc.
    - Protein 20-30% of total calorie intake
    - Increase Natural fats like nuts, butter, coconut oil, olive oil as they are least likely to stimulate insulin
    - Protective factors like Vinegar, Fibre

11. Fasting
    - Intermittent fasting of 24H to 36H
    - Can drink water, coffee, tea(without milk)
    - No to all calorific foods/drinks
    - Can do gym/cardio during fasting
