Being Bhondu Vs Sophisticated, in most perspectives being sophisticated could implicate being "bhondu", especially in cut throat competitive areas like corporate worlds, where people like John Mack used to run around the floor screaming, “there’s blood in the water! Let’s go kill someone!”. You have to sell yoursself everyday, "highlight" yourself, come forward, network-socialize with people.

Being confident, and not being shy or too conscious.

Be friendly, approachable, lively, fun.
