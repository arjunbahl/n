## Pre-requisite
Levity is a mindset—an inherent state of receptiveness to (and active seeking of) joy.

## Power of humor
Fear is the greatest killer of creativity,” Asai explained, “and humor is the most effective tool I’ve found for insulating cultures from fear.”

# Underlying principles:
## Truth
- Sorry I’m late. I didn’t want to come.” This statement is funny because it’s truer and more direct than what we’re used to hearing—typically some tenuous excuse designed to disguise the fact that we just came from binge-watching
- Shared truths create the foundation for humor
- she had them do was make simple observations about their lives. “Never look for what’s funny,” she told our students, “Look for what’s true and go from there.”

## Misdirection
- Laughter also springs from the unexpected, when we think someone will zig and instead they ham sandwich. Social scientists explain this principle via the Incongruity-Resolution Theory, which holds that humor comes from the incongruity between what we expect and what actually happens.
- This is a fancy way of saying that people like being surprised
- Plenty of humor falls flat not for lack of a clever idea, but for lack of misdirection


To find humor, Close believed, we must examine the qualities, opinions, predilections, and feelings that make us who we are.



# Methods for finding:
## Incongruities
- It can mean looking for differences between how you behave and how other people behave.
- Comedy is very good at framing these inconsistencies—at saying: "‘Wait a minute, it’s not supposed to be that way. Here’s why that’s weird.’"
- Or this line from Jerry Seinfeld, highlighting the dynamic of owners picking up after their pets:
    - Dogs are the leaders of the planet. If you see two life forms, one of them’s making a poop, the other one’s carrying it for him, who would you assume is in charge?


## Emotions
- Comedians pay close attention to emotion. What makes them feel embarrassed, happy, sad, proud, uncomfortable, or anything else—strongly? These outsized emotions can be stellar entry points for humor.
In addition to Matt’s two questions, ask yourself: "What makes me happier than it objectively should? What frustrates me more than it seems to frustrate other people? What do I absolutely loathe, for no good reason?"
-  comedians rant about things that inspire irrational anger
    - “I hate parties. But then to have to go to an after party? Are you kidding me?!?”), college basketball (“Is there no vaccine for March Madness yet?!”), and birthday cards (“What do I do with old birthday cards? Keep them? Throw them away? They’re useless. No more cards please. Email me.”)
- When tapping into your anger in your own jokes, be sure to temper your temper. Directing a rant directly at a target will hurt feelings and won’t feel funny. But if you’re able to take those feelings and direct them at an amusing, fictionalized cartoon version of whatever it is that annoys you, other people may be able to feel how you feel without feeling personally attacked.


## Notice what you think
- Think about things that make you say I will never understand why ________ is the norm.


## Pain
-  plenty of pain becomes funny only after a certain amount of time has passed. The farther we get from the event itself, the easier it is to gain some perspective and see the humor in it.


## Delight
- Priming effect & what happens after:
    - By looking out for say, levity, we activate our brain to be cautious for triggers leading to higher receptive capability for it.
    - More likely to find it
- Laughter is contagious




# Methods for forming:
- Exaggeration
- Contrast
    - If incongruity used to find then contrast/justaposition already present, else create it
