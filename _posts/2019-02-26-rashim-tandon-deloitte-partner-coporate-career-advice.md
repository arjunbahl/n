> In order to progress further make your senior redundant.

Â 

He shared the story, he'd gone to US as manager however they assigned him a level below designation- AM. Due to no apparent reason the Manager there left in middle, he took up charge and assumed his responsibilities without any explicit instructions from anyone, that too while his official designation was AM and not Manager. Soon he completed work which a manager should've done and performed well on those responsisbilties making him look eligible as a Manager and not AM and subsequently he was made a Manager there.

He made the senior role redundant as he performed equally well and stood up to responsibilities of such senior role even though he wasn't officially designated.

He took initiative, created an oppurtunity for himself, didn't wait for anyone else to assume responsibilites for left out manager to be replaced.
