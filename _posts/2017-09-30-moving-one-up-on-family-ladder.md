Yesterday my nephew was born, and i already feel i have someone to look after, someone to take care of, i've to be someone's godfather. But most of all i will be the best friend of someone.

There is him who'll have his coolest friend who would be taking him out, playing games and being "allowed" to win discreetly, supporting his demands, fulfilling them, his best amigo.

I'll have to be the one protecting him, his silent guardian.
