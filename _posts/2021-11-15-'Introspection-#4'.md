After joining Dynamic Orbits, i learned i don't find Financial Modelling interesting, instead i find work where you strategise, apply mind, where there's some meaning behind the models you make or deep understanding, and its majorly not simply mechanical work that "potentially" can be automated but at present is not because of limitations in technology like faulty OCR renderings on scanned copies and then manually typing them in Excel.

I like doing creative work.

Not monotonous work based on "set" of rules or protocols.

Where i can "apply" and "combine" my skills and thoughts or ideas instead of "just doing" them.

Maybe that's why i was inclined towards Research work(scientist) earlier in 10th during contemplation.

Work which helps in pushing boundaries outward, which is meaningful.
