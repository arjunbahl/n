Not to pick someone specific as well as not justified to make fun of someone/something you are unexperienced about

Pain to comedy transition is via overstatement and understatement.

Often the comedian is the victim of the scene.

by behaving in an unusual way, by being in an unusual place, by being the wrong size.

Slapstick and Violence

Laughing at others' pain and humiliation Early American violence and Mack Sennett's contribution of the Keystone Cops "The more real it is, the funnier it is" Pain in comedy is conveyed by Over-exaggeration Under-exaggeration

Magic and Surrealism

The similarities between comedians and magicians Sudden appearances or disappearances Georges Méliès: "the first person to make surreal jokes using film magic" Exaggerated movement speeds (speeding things up) Comedy is rooted in fear Haunted house movies use the principles of appearances/disappearances

Imitation and Parody

Parody is exaggerated imitation (imitation that implies ridicule) Satire: parodying a person who represents "power" or "authority" Parodies of pop culture use three kinds of comedy

Imitating the mannerisms of a well-known character Jokes about the physical mechanics of the parody Imitation of the visual style of the original

Mime and Body Language

The comedy of personality (as opposed to comedy about gags) is about doing something normal in a funny way (expressed through body language) Jacques Tati: made post-silent era films without dialogue

Jokes and Attitude

The Dim Attitude: stupidity and a lack of awareness (that's less than the audience) The Aggressive Attitude: Apathy toward others The Crude Attitude: vulgarity Charlie Chaplin: he was the master of visual comedy

The Character of the Physical Comedian

The comedian must be an "alien" to familiarities, customs, and traditions The comedian must have "innocence" as though they were "born yesterday" Harry Langdon: "an adult with the emotional and intellectual equivalent of an infant" Childishness comes out in the comedian's "battle" with objects (giving the objects a "life" of their own) The comedian must be clumsy by making mistakes and having accidents with objects The comedian will keep attempting something "long after a normal person would've given up" The comedian doesn't understand or just disregards "morality," "legality," or traditional conventions

Three Different Approaches from the Comedian's Manual of Sexual Relationships

The Romantic Approach: "his emotional age zooms up from childhood to early adolescence" The Direct Approach: "ignores all codes of proper behavior and acts on his desires" The Startled Virgin: a role reversal "with the woman as the sexual aggressor" and the male as a "bewildered child"

The Final Point

"The physical comedian is indestructible...whatever the odds against him, the comedian always survives to walk away at the end of the story." — Rowan Atkinson

so you see the world of vigil comedy is one where doves lurk in our underpants where cats are fifty feet high and buses can turn somersaults the joke's depend on some shocks and strange transformations that undermine the normal laws of our existence now let's have a look at some of the methods that are used to make these jokes happen slapstick is the most ancient and enduring tradition of physical comedy we seem to take a constant delight in seeing people hurt and humiliated by accidents and acts of violence Paul is gone the earliest American comedy films consist almost entirely of violent action that excitable character on the left there is Mack Sennett he was the first great genius of screen comedy and the inventor of the Keystone he was a complete panic Asst who delighted audiences around the world with films full of people fighting people chasing each other and people destroyed these weren't just comedies they were the Terminator and Robocop of their day right how'd it go the slapstick we tend to find funniest now is that from real life the comedian finds it difficult to compete with reality because the more real it is the funnier it is the more dignified the victim the funnier it is to get a laugh out of some act of slapstick violence these days the comedian must strive for believability oh and since Kevin seems to have difficulty achieving believability perhaps he needs the help of vegetables nowadays you have all the resources of the soundtrack to add conviction to your violence the secret is to find the vegetable which gives you the most authentic effect cabbage marrow broccoli ah right sound effect wrong reaction the comedians must achieve the shock of violence without the reality of pain the simplest way to transform pain into comedy is by the use of overstatement the overstatement may lie in the comedian's reaction to be hit the alternative to overstatement is understatement the physical comedian seems fated to be the victim of his own comedy and not only does he suffer from violence he is also constantly at the mercy of magic many of the tricks which the comedian uses to amuse us are similar to those which the magician uses to astonish for instance a lot of visual jokes are based on people suddenly appearing or disappearing the sudden appearance and the sudden disappearance are important elements in slapstick if someone falls over it is funnier if they disappear at the same time maybe seated and the fasts of people running in and out of doors is comic because it provides a rapid sequence of appearances and disappearances the faster a character shoots in and out of vision the more effective it is likely to be oh so EUL I was going great apart from appearances and disappearances the main business of the magician is to achieve transformations turning one thing into something else a magical transformation becomes comic when it is absurd as well as astonishing era great plus please one-click nobody is going to steal that yeah with the a trade you get one of these one click I'm the first person to make surreal jokes using film magic was George Miller working in France at the turn of the century his films are full of sudden appearances disappearances and transformations achieved through simple camera tricks of course when the comedy depends on tricks like these it has more to do with the mind behind the camera than the performer in front of it he has to resign himself to becoming a victim of the effects the most commonly used camera trick is that of speeding up the action this makes any kind of movement look mechanical and therefore comic it was a device much used by Melly a and it has never gone out of faith on your left eh the Parliament on your retirement I'm your look like a person Trafalgar Square right here we are at the seat

it has often been said that all comedy is rooted in fear the things we laugh at are closely related to the things which frighten us the world of spooks and hauntings for instance is very popular among comedians because haunted places are full of all those elements which make comedy happen like some appearances yes the special effects nowadays tend to be more sophisticated than a simple sheet over the head but the haunted house tradition lives on in films like ghostbusters there's a sudden appearance joke although the effects are more elaborate in an expensive film like this the principles of comedy are just the same there's an object come to life which is also a joke about proportion one of the joys of visual comedy is the sheer pleasure of being liberated from boring old everyday reality into a bizarre dream world where anything is possible comedy is a license to fish out the strangest images from the depths of our unconscious you may be starting to see how the different methods of visual comedy all tend to strip people of their normal human dignity you can achieve this by hitting someone over the head with a fish or by transforming them into a toilet but you can also do it simply by imitating them one person imitating another is funny the shear impedance of it is funny if the imitation is exaggerated it becomes parody this is imitation which implies some ridicule of the person being irritated if the person being parodied is a representative of power and authority then the parody becomes sat up high in satire visual comedy is used as a weapon screen test number 73 Ronald Reagan take 1 good thank you frankly my damn I don't give a dear cut hey 3 dearly my Frank I don't dam a gift ha hey 37 I dear I'm Frank give madam a doughnut Jack an endless amount of modern comedy is based on parodies of well-known films and TV programs this immediately gives the comedian a form and structure within which he can work the handy thing about parody to be frank is that you don't have to think up too many original ideas and you can still get three different kinds of comedy happening at once there's the fact that you've got the comedian imitating the mannerisms of a well-known character there are jokes about the mechanics of the parody itself and there is the opportunity to send up the visual style and beautiful if the production values don't quite match those of the original well you can say that's all part of the joke whether he's working in slapstick surrealism or parody or some combination of the three the comedian success depends first and foremost on his ability to create a funny character as Charlie Chaplin once said in comedy nothing transcends character and for the physical comedian this means his ability to communicate through his body language mime is very much Kevin speciality and his famous piano act is one of the highlights of his stage show you part of the pleasure is to do with illusion making a see what is not there but it is mainly about using the body to create character comic acting in other words through his body language the comedian can introduce intimacy and even elegance into the generally frantic world of physical humor the comedy may lie simply in the shadings of a facial expression particularly now in the age of TV where the close-up is so common this is the comedy of personality rather than the comedy of gags it's not about doing funny things it's about doing something quite normal in a funny way the skill lies in the accuracy of human observation and the precision of the execution you jacques tati and now there's an artist carried on the silent comedy tradition into the sound there by making films virtually without dialogue he was not only a creator of jokes but an observer of life who saw humor in the smallest details of human behavior he was a specialist in the comedy of character expressed through body language \[Music\] in visual comedy we see the same ideas crop up again and again whether the comedian often lies and simply inventing new variations of old jokes he can do this because the success of any comic idea depends not just on the skill with which it is executed but more importantly on the attitude with which it is performed new attitude this is the first comedy ever put on to film nearly a hundred years ago in 1895 a boy stands on the gardeners hose he lifts it foot and the gardener gets a face full of water it's the humiliating surprise the basic practical joke it doesn't come over too funny now to be frank because it is crude predictable and essentially characterless however if Kevin approaches the same situation of man and her type with different kinds of comic attitude we should see how it can be brought to life in different ways by introducing character into the comedy number one the dim attitude the comedy of stupid the crucial element in the character of the comedian is his lack of awareness he knows less than the audience about what is going on the dim comedian confronts the world with a kind of bewildered innocence number two the aggressive attitude the crucial element in the character is his lack of consideration for others if a keen one is coming now number three the crew damages the comedy of vulgarity so which comic attitude is funniest but only the one you find funniest is the one with which you identify most only if you identify with the comic attitude can you love Kate Chaplin for instance the whole world found it funny in his day but hardly anybody lasted it now why he certainly far more skill than invented that a lot of model comedians who we do love it he does everything it is possible to do with visual comedy including all the things we've talked about so far he wears comic clothes he has a comic walk and he is an expert in using his body he is constantly transforming hipster turning himself into a movie or an animal or an object his films are full of slapstick an acrobatic stunts there is a relentless sadism understated violence and overstated violence there are surprising appearances and disappearances there is surreal and there is invitation he is an expert by and a shop observer of human behavior Chaplin was also a perfectionist in the execution of his comedy doing hundreds of takes to get things right and yet however much we admire him it is however most of us these days to actually laugh at his feelings \[Music\] there is often a considerable gulf between what can be described as comic that what we personally find funny the problem with Chaplin is that it is hard for us to get involved in what he does he is distance trust by time by The Silence of his films but the main difficulty I think is that we just can't identify with his attitude anymore he seems too keen to too pleased with himself over the best physical comedians always have a strong character and attitude of their own they also have a surprising amount in common there are certain qualities of character which come up again and again because these are the qualities that make visual comedy \[Music\] \[Music\] the first thing to say here is that the physical comedian is an alien he comes from the other side of the looking glass he is like us but differently whereas the verbal comedian is often smarter sharper and faster than those around him the physical comedian usually has a quality of innocence of having been born yesterday Harry Landon is one of the weirdest of the lot someone once said that he looks like a baby dope fiend he is an adult with the emotional and intellectual equipment of an infant the comedians childishness emerges first of all in his difficulties with objects he is constantly doing battle with them in a way which invests them with a life and soul of their own but there is just as much potential in very simple domestic objects it is battles with objects the comedian is bound to be a net in order for funny things to happen he must constantly make mistakes and he must constantly be susceptible to accidents I love your show although he is clumsy and inept the physical comedian is very tenacious he keeps on doing things long after the point where the normal person would have given up if we take Kevin into a fashionable restaurant the one thing he won't do is sit there and behave himself in order to amuse he needs to be uncivilized he either doesn't understand social conventions or he isn't capable of following them allow me mrs. Claypool mr. Nedley mr. Gaffney mrs. lightbulb mrs. Claypool mr. Kelly mr. Godwin mrs. Piper mrs. Claypool I could go on like this all night but it stopped on my suspenders the physical comedian not only disregards conventions he's got little regard for morality or legalities and he has none of that consideration for others which inhibits the rest of us from behaving like conveniens all the time now let's see what happens if we swap it around so that Kevin becomes the waiter and mr. Driscoll becomes the customer since waiters are supposed to be polite hard-working and competent the comedian can't go far wrong if he is rude lazy and useless if he were to conform to social expectations he wouldn't be funny anymore now let's see what happens if we swap it around so that Kevin becomes the waiter and mr. Driscoll becomes the customer since waiters are supposed to be polite hard-working and competent the comedian can't go far wrong if he is rude lazy and useless if he were to conform to social expectations he wouldn't be funny anymore one way or another the physical comedian has got to be a threat to decent and respectable people he may be aggressive or he may be affectionate but the comedian is always causing offence and spreading confusing hey he makes a mockery of all authority politeness and pretension I'll take this side my business but I think there's a race of woodpeckers in the orchestra drunkenness like childishness immediately supplies the comedian with the stupidity incompetence and irresponsibility that he needs in order to be funny the physical comedian is certainly no match for the verbal kind when it comes to flashes of searing insight visual comedy is a more blunt instrument but this means that everyone can understand it most of the time you only have to be human to get the joke since he is such a maladjusted outsider the physical comedian finds it hard to form normal human relationships with women he's bound to get it all wrong let's have a look at three different approaches from the comedian's manual of sexual relationships this first one will call the romantic approach his emotional age zooms up from childhood to early adolescence this leads us straight into the comedy of embarrassment as all his efforts to appear impressive abound to come to grief my body say nice ready think we're on a winner archery all right play it nice and cool some nice and cool you know what I mean the second possibility is the direct approach the comedian simply ignores all codes of proper behavior and acts immediately on his desires there you've got a nice pair there enough thought shut up your city bitch is any bit of fun the third possibility we might call the startled virgin this one depends first of all on the comedy of role reversal with the woman as the sexual aggressor while the comedian is impossibly innocent he remains a bewildered child masquerading as an adult the physical comedian is really the ultimate outlaw as we've seen he breaks all the rules of decorum and convention he does all the things we can't couldn't and shouldn't do in real life you can't break the rules without getting into trouble and consequently the physical comedian is suffering most of the time he is an eternal victim subject to constant hostility from all quarters well that's about it I think we're finished with Kevin now so I just like to make one final point the final point being that the physical comedian is indestructible ah thank you yes that split-second timing when instinct tells you that ha the wave of assassination whatever the odds against him the comedian always survives to walk away at the end of the story however whatever you say about comedy the opposite is also true so if you like you can ignore everything I've said ah was that okay you
