# Digital Piracy

## Has Digital Piracy rifted up?

![1x-1](images/1x-1.jpg)

Turns Out No. Infact the data presents completely contradicting view. BitTorrent traffic has gone down, that too 9%. The alltime top pirated content, be it movies or games or music have one thing in common, their time period. It is seen 2009 to 2011 is the most pirated time duration with peak pirated content.

Compared to that it has gone significantly down in 2015. So does that mean Piracy has gone down or effective ways/ technologies have come into play?

### **Have Developers Done Anything For It?**

**The answer lies with [DRM Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management).**

> Computer games sometimes use DRM technologies to limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled.

 

## Analysis Of Music Piracy

- _iTunes:_

> In April 2009, all iTunes music became available completely DRM-free.

> In October 2007, the cost of iTunes Plus tracks was lowered to US$0.99.In April 2009, all iTunes music became available completely DRM-free.

- _Napster:_

> Users of the subscription service(Napster) can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to Windows Media Audio (WMA) while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews his or her subscription.

- _Kazaa:_

> Music downloads from the Kazaa website are DRM-protected, and can only be played on computers or portable devices running Windows Media Player, and only as long as the customer remains subscribed to Kazaa

 

But Why Do Companies Are Against DRM Protection Enabling Pirated Content?

> Major labels have begun releasing more music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that this is because the record labels are "slowly beginning to realize that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store."

## Piracy In BluRays

> A cryptographic mechanism related to Trusted Computing is [Broadcast Encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_encryption). This is specifically used in [Blu-ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray). This is a way to symmetrically encrypt data such that:
> 
> - every Blu-ray player in the world has its own decryption key;
> - players refuse to play unencrypted data;
> - a given disk "includes" the encryption of the movie for every single player key.
> 
> A lot of science goes into the details, so that a single disk may indirectly contain the encrypted keys for billions of potential players. The scheme is based on nested binary trees and a "revocation" system: a disk cannot really contain one encrypted key per target player, but it can cryptographically revoke a few hundreds of "bad keys" known to have been hacked. There again, this is a cryptographic system which does not ensure that movie data will not be extracted, but at least enforces the need of an hardware-based hack on a given player, that attackers must do again on a regular basis because widespread leakage of data can be counteracted through revocation. It is unclear whether the Blu-ray protection scheme (called AACS) will stand the test of time, but it surely is much stronger than that of the plain DVD.

 

 

## Piracy In Games

[Actually it is possible to stop Gaming Piracy!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/14/can-video-game-piracy-be-stopped-in-two-years.html)

But Boards find it profitable to grab the market share on the cost of stopping piracy.

> Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people don't pay for the software. Someday they will, though. And as long as they're going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade. -- Bill Gates

Its very intriguing to note that companies, mainly studios targeted with piracy are not doing much to protect there content, even though technology is out there.

> In January 2016, 3DM reportedly nearly gave up attempting to crack _Just Cause 3_, which is protected with Denuvo, due to the difficulties associated with the process. They also warned that due to the current trends in encryption technology, in two years' time, the cracking of video games may become impossible. Denuvo's Thomas Goebl believes that some console-only releases may get PC release in future due to this technology.

### Reason? Lets Go Under...

 

## Piracy-Good?

> “Would the college student watching the pirated movie download have otherwise seen the movie in the theater, subscribed to Netflix or bought the DVD?” Rose told Forbes. “Would the person buying a pirated DVD at a Chinese market actually have bought the genuine article otherwise?  The answers to such questions are hard to determine.  But it does seem fair to assume that not every pirated copy of an audiovisual work represents lost revenue to the content producer.”

Here's what the Adobe Executive, company who is targeted with highest piracy level at an alltime high with its Adobe Suit, said:

Adobe touched on this when it launched the Creative Cloud subscription model. Adobe executive David Wadhwani explained that the reason people pirated their software wasn't out of malicious intent, but what we all knew already: "they wanted to use high-quality software, but couldn't afford it:"

> _I do not think people who pirate our software do it because they are bad people, or because they like to steal things. I just think that they decided that they can not afford it. And now, with the switch to subscriptions and with the ability to offer software at a cheaper price, we see that the situation is beginning to change and we're excited._

_Even Warner Bros. believe in the unseen and oblivious advantage of Privacy, here's what there executive said:_

> _Generally speaking, we view piracy as a proxy of consumer demand...Accordingly, enforcement related efforts are balanced with looking at ways to adjust or develop business models to take advantage of that demand by offering fans what they are looking for when they are looking for it._

Recently most downloaded TV Show Game Of Thrones, the people concerned with the shows production raised a very intriguing question:

> On the contary would GoT had been as successful as it is now if it hadn't been shared on web as pirated content?
> 
> The big question though is if Piracy didn’t exist at all and people only watched the show via HBO, SKY or other legal alternatives, would there have been such an incredible buzz for it around the social networks resulting in the show going viral?

_Turns out Piracy after all saved them millions of Advertisement Expenditure. Does this mean Piracy is Sinless?_

At last, Microsoft one of the Fortune 500, infact has been benefited from Piracy. Pirated windows content has created an artificial windows ecosystem in the world giving way to only Windows Enabled Content, creating an artificial monopoly for the TechCo.

## Primary Reason For Piracy

> In a recent study, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC) suggested that the main reason that consumers commit online piracy is price, but that earlier access to content, the perception of peer acceptance and the proliferation of ad-supported websites offering free content are also to blame. (“Discovering behaviors and attitudes related to pirating content,” PriceWaterhouseCoopers, LLC, www.pwc.com, 2011.)

**_Real Testimony_**:_Here's what an Actual Pirate says about what and why he does it?_

> I am a pirate. The reason I pirate video games rather than purchasing them is simply because I can’t afford to waste money on games that I won’t play. Most AAA games no longer put out demos, so why should I pay $60 for a game that I don’t know anything about? With the DLC nowadays, how do I know that my $60 game doesn’t require $30 in DLC?
> 
> I’ll use Skyrim as an example. Skyrim was my first Elder Scrolls game. I had no idea if it was worth the $30 I was going to pay. I pirated it, played for a couple of hours, then bought the game because I enjoyed it.
> 
> Same deal with Civilization; 5 was my first and I already knew I was no fan of turn-based games. Now I legally own V and Beyond Earth. I pirated Civ VI and found that I wouldn’t get enough enjoyment out of it, so that is a purchase reserved for later, assuming there will be updates that fix some bugs.
> 
> I pirated Mount & Blade: "Warband to try it out, and now I own the entire collection including all DLCs on Steam."
> 
> Games that have an open beta usually provide enough info on whether or not I want to buy the game, so I don’t pirate those. (These are games like Battlefront and Rainbow Six Siege.)
> 
> I own Call of Duty Modern Warfare through Modern Warfare 3. The next installment took a leap into the future so I pirated it, played for about an hour and then got rid of it. Paying $60 for this game and only getting one hour of enjoyment is definitely wasted money to me.
> 
> I will admit, Steam's refund policy is definitely moving me away from piracy. I can refund the game if I have played 2 hours or less, which is perfect for unknown purchases.
> 
> If I enjoy a game that I have pirated, I always make I buy it. I will not buy a game for $60 if there is a chance that I won't like it.
> 
> My point is, I would rather not buy a game than pay for the unexpected. I never planned on buying Skyrim before I pirated it, and now according to Steam, I've racked up 400 hours. If anything, I bought Skyrim BECAUSE I pirated it. In some ways, piracy is making sales as well.
> 
> People are making very good points in the comments and I'd like to address a few things.
> 
> As I've already said, I pirate less now that Steam has a refund policy. That doesn't mean that every game is on Steam, though.
> 
> Your restaurant analogies are way off. Next time you're in a restaurant, make sure you don't try some of your buddy’s chicken burger. If you want to eat some chicken, go buy your own since, you know, trying before buying without the restaurant’s permission is moral suicide.
> 
> Would you be okay with buying a $60 no-refunds drink based on strangers’ reviews, only to find out you didn't like it? Is it more morally acceptable for them to say “we can charge what we want” than it is for you to try someone else's drink before you buy?
> 
> You can sit on your moral high ground and blame me for the collapse of indie devs. Considering my entire argument is against $60 AAA titles, I don't see your point about indie studios.
> 
> Not once did I advocate for piracy. I said it can \*make\* sales where there were none beforehand, however, I still think you should support developers where you can. Take a page from EPIC’s book: "Unreal Tournament 4 is free and you pay what you want. Similarly, all Arma 3 DLC content is free for all players but comes with a watermark/pop-up asking you to buy."
> 
> Finally, to everyone talking about ruining indie studios, have you ever bought a WinRAR license?
