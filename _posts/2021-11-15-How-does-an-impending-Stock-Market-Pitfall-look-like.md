The stock surged _**569%**_ in 3 months.

But interesting part is the quantity traded everyday, note that on 35 days out of 40 days only 1 trade took place. That's what tells us that its the case of Pure Manipulation.

The operator(s) here would one day dump it all on retail investors, if they enter in the trade, and they themselves would dump their position onto them. As soon they sell their position the price will start declining rigorously, as no one would be supporting its overpricing. In the end retail investors would suffer hue loses, while the operators(group of Brokers, sub-brokers) would have made whooping gains out of it.

Never enter into such trades, interestingly such occurrence is affirmation of the fact that people in the market do ride such trades, may close their position in profit or usually in losses.

 

Although if we could identify such situations early, gains are incredible for obviously small quantities of trade, if the operators are not able to withdraw their positions from such trades majorly.
